today , the ukrainian parliament dismissed , within the code of criminal procedure amendment , the motion to revoke an article based on which the opposition leader , yulia tymoshenko , was sentenced .
in october , tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvantageous gas deal with russia .
tymoshenko claims the verdict is political revenge of the regime ; in the west , the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased .
the story of libya 's liberation , or rebellion , already has its defeated .
the transitional cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary sharia law , of which we have already heard .
women can forget about emancipation ; potential religious renegades will be executed ; etc.
libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .
when winners are sought for in libya , the west is not on the list .
given the recent bad experience from afghanistan and iraq , we decided against military occupation of libya .
without the occupation , will the oil companies get libya 's black gold for next to nothing , though ?
france and the rest of europe are now in the investors " spotlight .
individual countries released their 3q gdp data .
eurozone statistical offices in germany , czech republic , and some other countries , released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter .
both countries also adjusted their second quarter data , where germany did better than expected ( a 0.3 % increase instead of the original 0.1 % ) . france reported a slight decrease , by 0.1 % ( the original information suggested stagnation ) .
between the quarters though , the gdp stagnated . according to the czech statistical office , this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowing of economic growth .
based on preliminary and seasonal data , in the third quarter , the german economy grew by 0.5 % .
despite the fact that the situation in the region is getting worse , earnings of czech 1 - year bonds stay under 4 % .
football representation successfully managed the toughest task of the season !
in the second half , czech football was lucky to maintain its luxury lead from the home return match , and will again feature at the european championship .
nearly no excitement in the first half , and a great portion of luck in the other .
perfect czech team defence only allowed the montenegro team to threaten in the second half .
the wonderful petr čech is one of the reasons the czech representation team will not miss the next year 's european championship . and czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million czech crowns .
both teams found it difficult to join in the combination ; the game remained around the mid - field line most of the time .
iranian students are prepared to die for their country 's nuclear program
several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear power plant in iran .
at tuesday noon , students ' prayers in front of the building were followed by their chanting of death to both the usa and israel .
this way , they express their readiness to protect their country 's nuclear program with their own lives .
possible attack on iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in israel .
in case of an attack , aimed at the highest possible paralysation of the iranian nuclear program , the targets would be , based on israel press , the facilities in both isfahan and natanz , where the uranium is being enriched .
over a third of children between 9 and 13 are overweight ; while 9 % of schoolchildren are overweight , 5 % are obese .
again , we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development .
over 19 % of obese children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the educational event called obesity is no accident .
it was the second year of the obesity is no accident event supported by both všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna insurance company and unilever .
proper diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either overweight or obese .
in the czech republic , only 23 % of schoolchildren 's families have breakfast together .
the worst discovery was the fact that in one tenth of households people do not have breakfast at all .
a survey has shown that fries are consumed more often in the families of obese children .
though over 40 % of children do sports regularly , the number drops down to less than a half - 15 % - when it comes to their parents .
another part of the survey allowed selected children ( 204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools ) to compose their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions .
their favourite meals include large number of flour , meat , and sweet dishes .
as the main dish for lunch , pasta won very tightly over poultry .
" many participants from the survey control group showed a significant shift of preferences towards healthy food when completing a questionnaire after the end of the obesity is no accident educational lecture , " project results show .
in addition , for their main course , children ticked poultry and fish more often , limiting sweet meals and dumplings .
in the opening article on stylist training , i was complaining a bit about the amount of information in the introductory lessons .
lectures by three experts from the field ; dressing tips for difficult figures ; and a seminar on how it works in practise .
the closer we get to the final exam , the more information and practical tasks await .
this time , together with alenka , the director , ( there is not a single man in the course ) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry .
one has a short neck , the other has a boyish figure without proper curves , yet another is overweight .
we were given tips on how to accentuate the figure of women such as jennifer lopez , i.e. with bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist , and not to dress them too provocatively .
you will definitely not regret the investment , as perfectly fitting clothes are priceless .
boyish figures , on the other hand , can wear clothes with ruffling , appliqué , embroidery , or shirring .
still , i fear it is too much , with regard to the homework we were given .
we must consider their current appearance , their fashion style , and figure type .
inside i rejoice , as she is so much easier to dress than , say , britney spears , christina aguilera , who has recently gained about a ton ( please , understand i am exaggerating ) , or the very young selena gomez .
moodboard , as the result is called , then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depiction .
a stylist does not just dress physical people , but creates product pages in magazines ( based on specific instructions , for example , trendy purses , coats , etc. ) .
saturday 's lecture , filled with information on figure types , was livened up by three guests from the field .
jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion , and a stylist should be able to use this fact .
another option is rolling up the sleeves or collar , and the entire look changes completely .
however , i appreciated the following advice the most : " for your work , you need to know the rules perfectly . "
here i finally understood why we drill all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why , while in fashion magazines we often see something else .
from ben , the photographer , i learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of .
now i also know that in the picture , a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality .
honza pokorný confirmed that image and style often are half the success .
the attitude towards stylist services is still rather cold in the czech republic .
and if someone finally lets us create their styling , then we should expect them to give us different ( smaller ) size than what they really wear .
on sunday , both honza and mario were stressing the fact that for a stylist it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an outfit .
to be able to estimate people , not to pander , and stick to one 's opinion .
" find at least a few pieces you can praise , and recommend what to wear them with " mario says .
that is the bag you fasten around your waist to carry all the props you need .
to have some change from listening , and gain some practical experience , we learned how to properly underlay shoe soles .
i am beginning to realise that to be a professional stylist is no piece of cake , no matter what people say .
the ambitions were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work .
it promised to shift the old need for speed racing series in a new direction ; the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing genre .
typical for the nfs series though , in the end many things are different from what we expected .
this means they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an incomprehensible laziness of the developers .
you are introduced into a story , where the main character , jack , decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across america .
this means each race takes place on a different route , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments .
despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series , some of the environments are very nice to look at .
driving through the desert , autumnal countryside , or high in snow - covered mountains is visually very pleasant though .
for example , in the desert , you get into a sandstorm , significantly decreasing the visibility .
for a while , you try to overtake a number of competitors ( basically a regular race ) ; then you try to beat the time ( standard stopwatch race ) ; or you are in a duel with a single rival .
it actually turns out to be good for the game , because this feature does not get to be boring ; within what was already said , it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining .
this means that it is nothing special anymore , but it cannot be considered a negative .
still , this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing , even though we could find better at the competition .
from a game of this type , one does not expect complicated deformations and collisions , but when you have no idea , before crashing into any object , how your car will act , something is not right .
the restarts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track , the game takes you back to the last interrupted point .
if you use them up , you have to start the race from the beginning .
sometimes the restarts are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart .
for example , some turns have to be driven through in a specific way , otherwise you simply do not fit in .
this is especially annoying in situations where you can see how your rival drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily , while when you get there , the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down .
this is most obvious at the end of the game , on a long bridge , where you are driving in the opposite direction .
the thing is that when he is driving in front of you , he makes your vision worse , which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section .
it 's a pity , because despite the simple driving model , the game is entertaining and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
the key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode ; these are the races in individual locations you know from the story .
various features unlock fir getting a higher driver level : starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds .
yet another setback difficult to understand ; is the situation from the last race in the story .
your speedometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( let 's say it does ) , when suddenly , a subway train comes running down from behind you , turning your car into a pile of scrap metal .
the technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary ; but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant , sometimes even great .
this especially concerns accidents with large number of participants , where fluent recoding would not help you much anyway .
in order to please the widest possible young audience , the soundtrack is ' flecked in from all quarters ' ; but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music .
if the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes , we could sincerely say that the run is the best part of nfs for the past several years .
it surely is a nice entertainment , but prepare to be blinded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spotlights .
the third year of the festa academia festival offers joining the international students ' day and velvet revolution anniversary with a musical event .
the main focus of the festival is on two concerts taking place on november 17 .
" participating choirs include the choir of the pedagogical department and humanities ; václav hampl , the rector , will be in the committee , " jakub čaloun , head of the organisation team says .
celebration jazz mass , a piece by an important czech jazzman , karel růžička is on the programme .
the aim of festa academica is to celebrate the international students " day and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the velvet revolution with dignity ; as well as to present the public with top quality choir music , and to develop creative cooperation among young people .
the entire event is under the auspices of bohuslav svoboda , lord mayor of prague , and václav hampl , rector of charles university .
the programme offers both ceremonial concerts and numerous musical meetings , students " happenings , matinées , and more .
" it will take five or six years before the situation becomes somewhat stable , calm , and before all players get used to their new roles , " eu ambassadress milena vicenová opened her lecture at the law department sharply .
moreover , vicenová praised the work of new long - term president of the european council , herman van rompuy :
" he is a person who can listen to all twenty - seven member states , communicate with them perfectly , and who has a clear vision of where the eu should be headed . "
she said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the czech republic .
as the ambassadress said , both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused an ongoing stirring .
whether the budget will be slim and frugal ; which fields will be given preference ; which countries will be supported more and which less ; all of that is on the coming agenda .
" i really do not like all the abbreviations , foreign words , and jargon no one understands .
she also wants to use the eu environment better , and get more czechs into european institutions .
the ambassadress says czechs are said to be euro - sceptics ; as well as people noticing the negative rather than the positive sides of things .
she thinks numerous factors are to blame : for example , the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters ; together with low support from the czech side .
" believe me that when i meet someone from poland and hungary , and a slovak is coming to join us , the frenchman next to me says : " hey , what 's that gathering about , is that the visegrad group again ? ' and he is not happy about it in the slightest . '
rather than a new european federation , she finds the concept of two - speed , if not multi - speed europe , very realistic .
" we have schengen area , and we already have an institute of reinforced cooperation . "
" the number of such institutes will be growing ; it will be a highly two - speed europe , " vicenová expects .
should someone search for the word that would best express the imb strategy , the closest one would probably be " long - term . "
the company 's durability goes back to its first boss , a visionary , thomas j. watson sr.
his motto : ' think ! ' thus become an imprint around which the life of the future giant would unfold ( as well as the name of its internal magazine that imb started to publish in 1935 ) .
" for us in imb , long - term thinking means continuous movement towards the future .
during our first century , this allowed us to transform the technology , business , and the company .
consistent with the anti - discrimination strategy is the current plan expecting a woman , virginia rometty , to take over after palmisano next year .
in the last few years , imb has been organising jams , on - line brainstorming sessions , from which many future strategies and innovations arise .
" from the beginning , the concept of ibm was that of an institution rather than a technology company , ' a harvard business school professor and author of a book about ibm , rosabeth moss kanter , told the economist .
as the company itself says , there is a difference between entering a market and creating it .
it seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software ; infrastructure ; hosting ; and consultation services within a range from servers to nanotechnologies .
its inventions include , for example , the cash point , pay card , financial swap , bar code , and floppy disc .
" if your business is defined by movement forward , you cannot be emotionally attached to the past , ' says samuel j. palmisano .
this is how it differs from , for example , its competitor , microsoft , which basically stands and falls on windows , its operating system .
ibm 's revenues chiefly consist of services , about one fifth for each comes from software and hardware .
since 2000 , ibm has sold low profitable assets worth 15 billion dollars . during the same time , it has invested 58 billion dollars into purchasing of perspective technologies .
ibm follows the legacy of its first director , thomas j. watson , who increased the amount of investments during the great depression .
since the beginning of 2008 , the price of ibm 's shares has grown by remarkable 120 per cent ; company 's net earnings have been growing continuously .
we may therefore expect that even if another crisis comes , this flexible giant will manage .
ibm ( international business machines ) was founded in new york , a hundred years ago . its original name " computing tabulating recording corporation " was quite complicated .
foundations for the later ibm were laid by a merger of four companies , the history of which goes back to the 1880s .
the architect of the new company was a businessman , charles ranlett flint , who , until 1930 , also presided over the company 's board of trustees .
the leader then put the ibm 's founder in the shade - watson 's ideas remain the base for invincible company culture and identity .
ibm , as its name suggests , started by producing and selling various business machines - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers .
watson became so essential for the company , that after nearly forty years , his position in the director 's chair was taken by his son , thomas watson junior .
in 1960s , both people and computers from ibm helped nasa control space flights - to mercury , saturn , and in 1969 , man 's flight to the moon .
the classic pc that defined the computer standards of the period , called ibm 5150 , came to the market in 1981 .
in the past three years , ibm has been highly successful with its smarter planet concept .
for commerce , ibm has recently introduced a smarter commerce platform that helps businessmen control the whole commerce cycle .
in former czechoslovakia , as the first country in both central and eastern europe , ibm founded its branch in 1932 .
the headquarters for both central and eastern europe resides in prague , where there also is a world level research team focusing on voice recognition .
iveto , keep the fool , i do n't want him anymore !
after her husband , josef rychtář ( 53 ) , became both the bodyguard and lover of iveta bartošová ( 45 ) , darina still hoped he would wake up and come back home .
" pepa may return home , but no longer as my partner , " rychtářová explained .
even though she had iveta move out of říčany 30 days later , pepa would not leave the singer .
after some time , darina resigned , pretended to accept her husband 's affair ; and now she gave him her final goodbye .
even if one day rychtář and bartošová would split up , his wife will not welcome him with open arms .
" however , he will complete his days not as my beloved , lost and found old fool , but as a person i have certain bonds to , " rychtářová said , adding she had already disengaged herself from her husband and only insists on mutual decency .
" my wife decided for marriage on paper , and i respect it . "
" darina and i communicate in a completely normal way , only we do not share our bed anymore , " rychtář said for blesk .
" we do n't sleep together , and i do n't care where she goes , with whom , and if she has a boyfriend .
dear ladies , do you recognise yourself in the lines to follow , describing several women 's habits that make the men see red ?
some women recognise they should somewhat control their passion for shopping .
shopping may be a hobby for a majority of women , but for men , it may become absolute hell .
" i need to lose at least five kilos - should i start doing some exercise ? "
then , you belong to the group of women obsessed by their appearance .
the stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of such complaints , the more annoying women are .
do you blame your partner for stepping onto the clean tiles in dirty shoes ; your children for messing up a clean sink and leaving fingerprints over the glass pane in the living room that was so difficult to clean ?
this harmless desire for cleanliness may threaten your relationships , as well as the entire family .
" wet dishtowels do not belong on the floor . "
naturally , you mean well , you just want everything to be perfect .
women are focused on relationships , which is why they like to discuss who , where , who with , how , and why .
in both cases , claude giroux , used the experience of a thirty - nine year old star ; he added an extra pass and was announced best player of the match .
after the match , jágr told the overseas journalists he had predicted a great evening for giroux .
a little bit later , second score for the team bore czech traces too .
a second before the first break , a home player , patrick dwyer , narrowed the lead in a power - play , but the beginning of the second part was led by flyers again .
after assist with jágr , he scored the third goal ; consequently , his shot was touched into a fourth goal by wayne simmonds .
" i do n't ; want to say he 's the best league player , but he 's definitely among the best three , " said jágr , complimenting his center .
" all those years in nhl , my team - mates tried to assist me , and now its reversing , " jágr added .
further complications were avoided by matt read who increased the difference to two points .
" he poked out the puck , i gained speed , and read went on to the more distant pole . "
its victory moved philadelphia onto the top of the eastern conference .
along with the experienced back , the candiens lost their two - goal lead and lost 2:3 after a penalty shoot - out .
more than lost points , the home trainer was sorry for high sick rate in the back , as the match was finished with just five defenders .
" we finished the match with just one experienced player , the rest were young men . "
" substitution by substitution , it was overwhelming and we could n't resist . "
" that was our weakness , " a defender , p. k. subban added .
jets " goals , which interrupted a five - match series of losses , were shared by five different scorers .
until 1989 , only five state travel agencies were allowed in the former czechoslovakia : čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea , and autoturist .
for their holiday , czech tourists thus went to the sea to the german democratic republic ; soviet union ( sochi , crimea near the black sea ) ; bulgaria ; romania ( both to the black sea ) ; and hungary ( balaton ) .
a great paradox of the socialistic period was that citizens of the socialist block ( i.e. czechoslovaks too ) were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries .
at the time , travel agencies would offer some trips to the west , but one either had to stand in a line overnight , with a sleeping bag or have some " good friends " in the agency .
a foreign currency assurance was essential for travels to the west . it was not granted to politically unreliable people , who were not allowed to travel at all .
most often , czechs spent their holiday at home , which resulted in great number of cottages and summer houses , a habit that survives until now .
while until 1989 , a holiday in the gdr or bulgaria was the climax of our travels , last year , czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries all over the world .
right at the beginning of 1990 , visa requirements for neighbouring west european countries were cancelled . this started a huge wave of short - term visits of chiefly vienna and germany .
for example , in paris , czech tours slept in parks in tents , because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or a pension .
another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible czech crown . after decades , our tourists thus finally able to freely buy western currencies .
since 1997 , increased demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips by charter airlines . compared to the past , air trips thus became unbelievably cheap due to the ability to order quantity discounts .
the next significant event in the history of after revolution travelling came in 2000 . high demand resulted in the historically first direct charter flight from the czech republic to an exotic country , thailand .
on november 17 , 2008 , the usa removed visa requirements for czech tourists . our country has thus permanently joined the world 's most developed countries .
jindřich rajchl , miroslav pelta , and tomáš paclík are eager to lead czech football .
however , hašek 's era sees football back in quarrels between both association chambers , unable to agree on a common candidate .
general meeting delegates wasted their trip to the national house in prague , smíchov , as the negotiations remained blocked , not just regarding the election method .
this single point has been partially settled since , thanks to a recommendation of the institute of state and law , according to which representation based on power of attorney is not possible .
the executive board has not been of much help either , though at its meetings , both regular and extraordinary , it is mostly preoccupied by this issue .
the question is : how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid mate ?
based on the model given by the by - laws , the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber he is the candidate for .
the czech part stresses a condition that in the percentage total , the winner must gain at least two - third superiority .
somewhat surprisingly tomáš paclík agrees with his opinion even if it is estimated that the election rules defined by the by - laws fits pelta best of the candidates .
" i want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense , as at the previous general meeting , " says the owner of viktorie plzeň , who is a candidate for the first time ; and in his statements he chiefly stood against pelta .
he believes the new president will be known in nymburk ; he also hopes that in the future , the candidates will cooperate constructively .
" football will be back on the happy wave , people will be more willing to cooperate , " a jablonec functionary says . of the three candidates , he has the most experience with football management on both professional and regional levels .
" i hope for an agreement , but the situation is very ambivalent . "
there is not much time left for an agreement between the parties .
an extra flight that was to take , among others , the vice presidents dalibor kučera and rajchl to podgorica did not leave prague in the morning due to a technical failure . an alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the barraged rematch .
minister of education , youth , and sports , josef dobeš , would like to force the split parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement .
paclík enters the presidential fight as he cannot see a suitable candidate
" if there was a good quality candidate , i 'd fight for him and not participate in the fight . "
paclík 's motivation to join the fight with miroslav pelta and jindřich rajchl is to try to prevent pelta , reportedly the favourite of the elections , from entering the top of the fačr .
in the future , he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager , not excessively connected to football life .
" i was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point , they do n't even want to identify themselves with czech football . "
at the moment , paclík 's strongest disagreement with pelta is based on the latter 's connection to roman berbr , president of pilsen 's regional football association . berber is a man of controversial reputation , who is , behind the scenes , known as powerful lobbyist , capable of influencing the votes of general meeting delegates .
" if he wins , current situation will be preserved and nothing in football would move forward . "
he is hinting at the fact that some years ago , pelta 's name was recorded during phone tapping in a corruption affair investigation ; pelta came out without a sentence .
" and how would we look in the eyes uefa and fifa , " paclík said . he is now more detached from his former statement saying he would " sell the pilsen club if pelta became president . "
this opinion is shared by another candidate , rajchl , whom paclík supported before the september general meeting that ended as a fiasco .
paclík claims he would dare to manage the association .
" i have the strength to make the football environment change , to support its improvement . "
one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between fačr and the czech olympic committee , with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax .
" if taxes are imposed on gambling , as the political parties declare , i understand their arguments , but they must clearly say where the money will go , " he said .
pelta is connected to jablonec , and rajchl to prague dukla .
" yet , i do n't see a point in transferring my shares in the pilsen club hypocritically to someone else , while coming back there in six months , " paclík says .
two days before the general meeting of the football association , one of the presidential candidates , miroslav pelta , promised that if he is elected , he would strive for new fačr regulations to avoid future disputes over the election rules .
prior to the failed election in september , pelta promised that if he was to win , he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means .
" people at all levels have been in football for long , and they expect the president to be known on thursday . "
this gives him the reason to believe he is experienced enough to manage czech football .
" unfortunately , regulations that were not as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in june . "
he approached the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a decoy for the delegates .
" it is a fundamental issue we cannot exist without , " pelta claims .
in the past , he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with jindřich rajchl , whom he recognises for his legal education ; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president .
" he 's been in football for over a year , and gained some success . "
" this is too , is why some of them now doubt his true character , " pelta said about his rival . pelta himself claims to be true to the proclamations he announced in september .
" right after that , i would focus on negotiations with both private and state sectors , to ensure enough money for the whole football , " the forty - six year old candidate told čtk two months ago .
" i 'd need to learn about the job descriptions of individual employees . " that was his message for strahov , where the long period of interregnum causes understandable nervousness .
" if the only questionable point is how to perform the elections in the third round that is something we can get over . "
rajchl promises that under him , the fačr will start working hard
rajchl promises that if he is elected , hard work will come .
he also promised to solve the bohemians case ; improve relations with both uefa and fifa ; bring more money to football ; and continue the work of the previous president , ivan hašek .
" from international contacts with uefa and fifa , to representation , professional football , and performance football for the youth . "
" i 'm a team player , and i want to distribute the competences within the executive board so that each member focuses on a certain area . "
" that would probably not please many people , as it would mean hard work , not just criticizing of the work of others , " he added .
" i 'm known to work 20 hours a day . "
" however , many people told me i must n't give up , otherwise others would follow . "
moreover , he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with hašek .
" processes have been started that may bear fruit in a few years , and i do n't want someone else to stop them , " he said , in fear that if the other candidate , miroslav pelta , is elected , situation f the association might return to the period before hašek .
" he is chiefly surrounded by people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones . "
furthermore , he refutes the allegations he would only be a czech president .
" for example , it is high time to consider about splitting the second league into czech and moravian parts , winners of which would continue into the first league . "
as the presidential fight has been joined by pilsen club manager , tomáš paclík , rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances to win .
on the other hand , he considers the fact that the association does not stick together partially as his own fault .
" no one can doubt that he did a great job in pilsen this year . "
" he would n't want to twist things for his own benefit , " rajchl said about his rival .
paddling pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in budapest . travellers can experience europe 's incredible water - and relax tired limbs in a jacuzzi after a city tour or a ramble .
there was one thing iris meder could not do without on research trips over the last one and a half years : her swimming costume .
she rushed to add any pool she liked to her notebook - with essential details on the construction and the history of the building .
her " journey to the most unusual baths in central europe " took here through 13 countries . besides germany , austria and switzerland , she visited baths in italy , france , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , romania and poland - and one city each in luxembourg , serbia and croatia .
she has very little enthusiasm for sport , says meder - but in the water , it 's a different matter .
" one day , i asked myself why swimming baths always have to be so ugly , " says vienna - based meder .
and swimming baths can be a real treat for the eyes if the builders have gone to the trouble . " you have the surface of the water in pools instead of a floor . "
everything is mirrored visually : high ceilings , colourful tiles and diving boards .
pool collector meder discovered some notable examples during research in hungary .
many of the heated outdoor baths in switzerland and austria , on the other hand , offer spectacular views . you can view all of zurich from a rooftop bath or look out on the snow - capped arlberg from an outdoor pool in st. anton . and there is a window in the steam bath giving a view of the action on the ski piste .
it steams during the winter from three open - topped shells dwarfed by the ötztal mountains behind it .
pool collector meder was not greeted by the smell of chlorine in every swimming pool .
the smell comes from the hydrogen carbonate in the alkaline water . the water is almost black with silt that sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a particular kind .
the baths , designed by the architect dušan jurkovic in 1902 , have been closed .
one place where decay has been stopped in its tracks is a magical swimming bath in the black forest - the palais thermal in bad wildbad .
following its careful modernisation in 1995 , the palais thermal is the favourite swimming pool of pool connoisseur iris meder - and not just because she comes from the black forest .
for german citizens the situation is clear . according to one study , 84 percent of germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize .
the findings were made in a survey conducted by the forsa institute for social research and statistical analysis on behalf of the consumer organisation foodwatch .
the author of the report , harald schumann , shows that betting on global commodities exchanges drives up prices - and the banks are therefore complicit in global hunger .
originally , commodity betting was designed as a means of protecting traders against price fluctuations .
in contrast to us competitors , ackermann has responded to the criticism . he has promised to investigate the accusations and has said that no trade is " worth putting deutsche bank 's good reputation at risk . "
the investigation should be complete by the end of the year when the findings will be presented to deutsche bank 's board of managing directors - with recommendations for action .
the president of foodwatch , thilo bode , welcomed the news while emphasising his criticism of the financial sector . " betting on rising food prices is an extreme example of how thoughtlessly banks are currently acting against the common interest . "
" deutsche bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that bet money on food prices , " said bode .
ackermann 's sensitive response is at first surprising , but then the ceo would like to present a perfect image just a few months before the end of his term in office .
cancelling contentious food commodity speculation could improve his image .
to date , more than 30,000 internet users have joined the organisation 's campaign .
no more than eleven percent think it is legitimate for deutsche bank to offer investments that bet on the price of foodstuffs .
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank , 49 percent said they would think about closing their account and switching to a different bank .
an architectural history with highs , lows and a happy - ever - after . austria 's pavilion for the 1958 world 's fair in brussels won prizes , became a museum in vienna , stood empty and was abandoned .
austria 's pavilion , designed by karl schwanzer for the 1958 brussels world 's fair , is a famous textbook example of modern post - war architecture with its clear shapes , glass halls , bold strokes and the new construction materials that expressed belief in technical progress .
he finally shot to fame internationally in 1973 with his legendary four - cylinder bmw tower and its bowl - shaped sister building .
however , the building was not suitable as a museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls to hang artworks and poor air conditioning .
the building stood empty from 2001 and fell into a worse and worse state of repair .
the museum is a branch of the belvedere museum , which will open the first exhibition on tuesday evening - a delight in every respect .
husslein - arco , an art history graduate with a remarkable career in her youth as an ice skater , who went on to sotheby 's , the guggenheim museum and to become the founding director of the museum der moderne in salzburg , convinced politicians and conservators to go ahead with renovation , attracted public funding and private sponsorship and decided on the use of the building .
he was known , of course , for having renovated and expanded joseph olbrich 's secession in vienna , and had won the competition , but he also studied under schwanzer at the vienna university of technology and the pavilion was an " exceptionally important place " for him where had visited exhibitions " almost every weekend . "
the problems facing the latest alterations were much greater . the building was " an energy guzzler , " says krischanitz .
thermal bridge steel girders were strengthened or replaced and asbestos was removed from ceilings .
the original external doors have been retained and the building has been painted in the old red - brown colour of rust - proofing .
all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a limited budget .
architecture like this is " always in the wrong place " and nonetheless wants to " stimulate a real awareness . "
there may also be a second stroke of luck . the 21er haus may be bolstered by another krischanitz building - the collector francesca von habsburg has purchased the temporäre kunsthalle berlin and is reported to be negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the schweizer garten .
deutsche bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in the winter .
referring to an internal crisis plan at deutsche bahn , the bild newspaper has reported that investment of around 300 million euros in total is planned up to 2015 .
the number of internal and external employees involved in removing snow from rail facilities and platforms is to double to 16,000 .
rüdiger grube , head of deutsche bahn , warned of train cancellations and delays this winter at a summit with government and industry two months ago .
deutsche bahn has also been forced to have the axles of ice trains checked significantly more frequently for many years , after an ice train 's axle broke in cologne 's main station .
fresh trouble is following hard on the heels of the uproar around josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank : deutsche bank faces a multi - million pound fine in the usa .
the value of the securities dropped dramatically during the financial crisis and brought down the credit unions .
the ncua chairman , debbie matz , welcomed the responsiveness of the two banks .
the regulator had also approached other major banks and sued jpmorgan chase , the royal bank of scotland and goldman sachs in the summer .
the us investment bank , lehman brothers , went belly up in september 2008 at the height of the financial crisis .
investors and regulators have brought a vast number of claims for compensation or to punish misconduct .
it accuses 18 major international banks of having taken in us lenders fannie mae and freddie mac on mortgage transactions valued at around 200 billion dollars .
the regulator is demanding that the frankfurt - based bank take responsibility for " substantial losses , " but has not yet specified the exact sum .
since march , he has bought up shares totalling more than ten billion dollars .
however , ibm 's annual reports changed his mind on investing in the industry .
buffett revealed that he had purchased ibm shares totalling 10.7 billion dollars since march on the us business news broadcaster cnbc .
buffett said that even ibm knew nothing of his involvement until recently .
" they have done a great job , " said buffett , referring to the management strategy .
the computer pioneer - now more than 100 years old - also provides software and consultancy services , as well as powerful business computers .
his holding company , berkshire hathaway , owns shares in a long list of major companies such as coca - cola and munich re ( formerly münchener rück ) alongside around 80 of its own subsidiaries .
his almost infallible instinct for making money has earned him a nickname as the " oracle from omaha . "
" big blue , " as ibm is also known , is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange , making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world alongside apple and microsoft .
following the discovery of the " zwickau cell , " turkish media express doubt about the rule of law in germany .
the murder of eight turkish and one greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of right - wing extremist ideology .
for many german turks , the news brings back to life a long - dead spectre . there has been no comparable right - wing extremist violence against turks since the arson attacks in mölln in november 1992 and in solingen in may 1993 .
the right - wing extremist network that has now been discovered , however , is on a scale that has not yet been fully understood .
the sabah newspaper , on the other hand , points out that one of the perpetrators was a confidential informant for the intelligence services and expresses concern that the german authorities may be caught up in the right - wing extremist quagmire .
just two weeks earlier , the turkish community in berlin had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the german - turkish bilateral agreement on labour recruitment in a ceremony with german and turkish politicians .
the coverage by some turkish media has been like a slap in the face . " germany 's present on the fiftieth anniversary " is the title of one article on the haber x turkish internet platform , which comments on the circumstances around the series of murders .
the behaviour of the police and the subsequently successful manhunt is heavily criticised on german - turkish internet forums .
some writers even go as far as some strong rhetoric . " if things continue to be done so cack - handedly , migrants have no option but armed self - defence . "
" peace in germany depends very strongly on how the entire network is uncovered and on the appropriateness of punishment , " writes " selen . "
the photo of the burnt out ruin of solingen is deeply engrained in german and turkish memory .
the attacks , however , increased the sense of turkish unity .
the turkish press at the time complained mainly of the failure of german policy following the attacks . helmut kohl declined to visit the survivors in mölln .
just as if he were calculating the value of a person by the taxes he pays .
straight talking is what is needed now , alongside efforts to identify and reassess right - wing extremist terrorism in germany .
the most risk - taking bank in europe is not in italy or france , but in switzerland .
after his spectacular departure from the head of the federal bank , it was announced in july that he would be starting an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013 : chairman of the board of directors of the major swiss bank ubs - an unexpected and lucrative career move .
but by september it was already clear that everything would be very different .
ubs ceo , oswald grübel - a banker not only famous in switzerland - had to go .
all at once , he is taking on responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again proven that it has long deserved the title of " europe 's biggest banking scandal . "
as a result , in 2007 ubs was managing 1.6 billion , thereby managing more more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world ,
" from what we know today , you have to ask how i could be so wrong . "
it only became clear in 2007 that something was really going very wrong at ubs .
ubs announced a capital increase , believe it or not , of 13 billion swiss francs to face the crisis .
the bank was forced to announce new losses running into the billions and chairman of the board of directors , marcel ospel - the second best paid chairman in switzerland in 2006 - resigned .
the national bank bought up toxic securities from ubs for untold billions and the swiss confederation paid six billion swiss francs for a mandatory convertible bond to become part owner of the bank .
after all , the balance sheet total for ubs in 2007 was more than five times the economic output of switzerland ( see chart ) .
ubs also agreed to pay 780 million dollars consisting of repayment of unjustified profits from the business and a penalty .
at the same time , ubs lost something that had always been its advantage when competing for rich clients - the fog of secrecy .
the ceo and the chairman then resigned and
the bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by aiding and abetting tax evasion .
one thing is clear - risk management in the investment banking division is still not working .
the cfo of one major german bank also has no doubts : " the problem facing ubs is that it does not having a handle on risk control . "
the safes of swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability , just as lindt and sprüngli had come to symbolise sophisticated chocolate .
the buildings are ostentatious and the shop rates are among the highest in europe .
the swiss banks have resided here for hundreds of years - from the national bank to the palace of credit suisse and elite private banks such as julius bär .
the walls within are clad in marble behind vast leather armchairs . there is a large sign to the " safe " next to the bank 's logo .
but both the major swiss banks , ubs and credit suisse , at some point ousted the swiss banking concept - or betrayed it , as the head of one small swiss private bank believes .
he believes ubs has grown too big - particularly in investment banking where the anglo - saxons are also very active .
" and if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the anglo - saxons long ago . "
the politicians approved up to 68 billion swiss francs ( around 45 billion euros ) to save the bank from bankruptcy .
talking to swiss banks , they see the issue mainly in the size of ubs .
a bank was created that was already too big for small switzerland when the merger was agreed - and a bank that continued to grow .
the internationalised investment bankers suddenly had access to a lot of money that they could use to turn an almighty wheel .
" i always thought that wuffli and ospel were a dream team , " says the banking research , hans geiger .
the american bank was the world 's most powerful investment bank .
ubs was a major player in foreign exchange and stocks .
hungry for growth , the bank itself and a hedge fund founded by the bank invested in us subprime securities .
even when other banks had long been looking for a way out , ubs carried on .
posts at ubs became a game of musical chairs and remain uncertain to this day .
he must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models .
the bank , however , is not ( yet ) prepared to go that far .
the new head of the bank , sergio ermotti , plans to present his future strategy to the world on tuesday .
since then , he has proved his mettle and is now to head ubs permanently , the zurich - based bank announced on tuesday .
publicly , he has only so far that he and his wife will look for a flat in zurich .
fear of recession in europe depresses us stock exchange
the change of government in athens and rome had little impact .
the general relief following the change of government in rome and athens was not sustained .
the italian and greek glass was still considered half full last week , not half empty - now the problems are coming to the fore once again , said mark luschini of janney montgomery scott .
the dow jones industrial average closed business at 12,078 with a fall of 0.6 percent .
the broader s&p 500 index closed at 1251 point , down one percent .
the eurostat statistics office announced that , in september , companies produced two percent less than in the previous month .
he also claimed that europe is not likely to shake off a recession quickly and that there are further signs of weakness in the banks .
in his opinion , it is therefore too early to invest in european government bonds or banks .
his investment of more than ten billion dollars in ibm boosted the veteran company 's share price by almost one percent against the trend during the course of trading .
buffett claims to have paid 170 dollars on average per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake .
bank of america share certificates fell significantly more strongly than the market by 2.6 percent .
the bank primarily plans to bolster its capital quota with the net profit from the sale to meet tougher regulations .
the share price went up 1.5 percent after the corporation picked up the biggest order in its history .
including options to buy 20 more planes , the total volume is in fact 26 billion dollars .
719 shares rose , 2281 fell and 79 remained unchanged .
some like the birds , others would like to get rid of them as fast as possible . crows have been part of the cityscape for hundreds of years , but residents complaining about the filth and noise the animals create are increasing in number in many communities .
experts at the first crow symposium in the east frisian town of leer have said that rooks can no longer be forced out of cities .
hunting , increasing development and felling of typical breeding trees was making life hard for the birds .
there are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the westphalian town of soest and in the north - west in jever , diepholz , achim bei bremen and leer .
critics described the capture of the birds in bird traps and how they were beaten to death with clubs as particularly brutal .
spraying off nests with water or felling trees often has undesired consequences , said environment expert manfred kaiser from lahr in baden - württemberg .
deterrence would only be conceivable as an exception in hospitals , retirement homes and schools .
without the surrounding area , the problem in the cities will not be solved , said leer 's mayor , wolfgang kellner .
" information boards instead of chain saws " was the slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist uta maria jürgens , who argued for a totally different approach to the birds . " we should have the self - confidence to live with this problem . "
the intelligence and skill of the birds are legendary . rooks often do not just use tools to get hold of a choice morsel , but create tools themselves .
in one experiment , the birds quickly learnt that they had to knock over a platform to get to a moth larva .
in a second experiment , the canny crows had to solve a trickier problem .
all four birds used the wire to form a hook and used the hook to fish the bucket out of the tube by its handle .
the favourites portugal , croatia and the czech republic , plus ireland , will be at the 2012 european championship .

croatia did not miss a trick with 0:0 against turkey and ireland managed an easy 1:1 ( 1:0 ) against estonia .
the former wolfsburg bundesliga professional zvjezdan misimovic and captain emir spahic evened the score with a converted 41st - minute penalty and a goal in the 65th for bosnia .
bosnia had already been knocked out of the world cup 2010 playoffs in south africa against portugal .
ronaldo pounded a free kick into the nets from about 30 meters to take an early lead .
the bosnians , with no opening in the first half hour , had their first opportunity with goal scorer edin dzeko .
following an attack on helder postiga in the bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute , stark decided the portuguese player had simulated and gave him a yellow card .
after half - time , the vice - european champions of 2004 settled the score with four more goals .
the european champions of 1976 are going to the euro championship for the fifth time in a row .

the winning goal was scored just before full - time .
four days after losing 0:3 in istanbul , the turks could do no better than a 0:0 draw in zagreb .

the budesliga legionaries danijel pranjic ( bayern munich ) and gordon schildenfeld ( eintracht frankfurt ) were on the field alongside mario mandzukic from vfl wolfsburg , who made space for ivan perisic from dortmund from the 62nd minute .
the irish in dublin were celebrating their first appearance at the european championship since 1988 in germany .
konstantin vassiljev equalised for the away team in the 57th minute .
the estonian rearguard prevented him at the last moment from taking ireland into the lead .

here is advice for proceeding : gently excise this page and make it your bookmark .
what he has written here is an unusual book , one he describes , not inaccurately , as " a work of anti - history . "
it 's not so much a book about what happened , he explains , as " a book about what it was like . " it 's about " feelings , impressions , experiences and moods . "
their lives flicker here like votive candles lighted in a church ; new ones are added to the mix while some wink out .
it is a corrective too to the notion that world war i was only about the dire trench warfare on the western front .
soldiers in this book have beehives fall on them ; one has christmas in egypt under the pyramids ; tsetse flies are an intractable problem .
war floods these people 's lives like a natural catastrophe , a hurricane katrina that reeks of cordite .
" lack of facts , " mr. englund observes , " has been padded out with guesses , suppositions , hopes , fears , idées fixes , conspiracy theories , dreams , nightmares and rumors . "
their stories are mostly taken from memoirs , letters and other already published material .
many of these are about deprivation and making do .
" substitute coffee , fake aluminum , imitation rubber , paper bandages , wooden buttons . "
he describes " meat made of pressed rice boiled in mutton fat ( and finished off with a fake bone made of wood ) ; tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel ; shoes soled with wood . "
conversely a british soldier realizes that he will most likely die , and that no one will notice or care .
instead , it is horribly like " a condemned man being strangled secretly . "
" the conflict has increasingly become an economic competition , " mr. englund writes , " a war between factories . "
people behave in unanticipated ways ; there is as much base behavior as heroism .
" the most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus , which soldiers buy and smear into their genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital , " he writes .
in this translation from the swedish by peter graves , mr. englund 's prose is supple but unshowy , perfectly suited to his humane task .
mr. englund 's volume joins an unconventional pantheon .
the overnight hours of monday into tuesday were chosen because zuccotti park would be at its emptiest .
police commissioner raymond w. kelly was at the center , his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department .
and so the police operation to clear zuccotti park of protesters unfolded after two weeks of planning and training .
a major disaster drill was held on randalls island , with an eye toward zuccotti .
the last training session was on monday night , on the manhattan side of the east river .
" the few cops that i know that were called into this thing , they were not told it was for going into zuccotti park , " said the person , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
one reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city .
the operation on tuesday involved officers from various police units , including boroughwide task forces - scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood high - crime neighborhoods .
" it was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park , " he said .
the lights and prerecorded messages booming from the loudspeakers seemed to cow many protesters .
no tents were touched until 1:45 a.m. , the police said , giving the protesters time to gather their belongings .
but many journalists said that they had been prevented from seeing the police take action in the park , and that they had been roughly handled by officers .
as the police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters " personal belongings , including luggage and plastic lawn and leaf bags stuffed with clothing , crews from the sanitation department followed , scooping up what was left behind .
a core group of protesters took up positions close to the encampment 's kitchen area , near the center of the park .
about 10 people in the epicenter of the encampment locked themselves together by their arms .
the clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later , the police said .
most of the arrests were for " disorderly conduct and resisting arrest , " he said .
phil t. pulaski , the department 's chief of detectives , was also there .
a second group of officers waited along the eastern side of broadway , between liberty and cedar streets , in case they had to move in .
from those positions , the police were seen expanding the perimeter even farther outward from zuccotti park .
around 5 a.m. , south of pine street , one protester jumped on the hood of a police car , and others were seen releasing the air from the tires of a police van .
in the end , one officer and one protester were hospitalized .
the union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on wednesday , claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students .
six hundred seventy - two school aides , parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city 's lowest paid lost their jobs on oct. 7 , in a move union leaders have described as political payback for their refusal to let the city access a health care fund run by labor groups to close its budget gap last spring .
at a city council hearing last month , schools chancellor dennis m. walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget they signed off on in june .
district council 37 officials said they filed a notice of claim , warning the department of education that it would be sued ; it will hold a news conference on wednesday to announce the lawsuit 's filing formally , in state supreme court in manhattan .
elizabeth thomas , a spokeswoman for the city 's law department , said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations .
it points out that while there were no layoffs on staten island and few layoffs in schools in the upper east side or tribeca , 17 school aides lost their jobs in district 23 in brownsville , brooklyn , and 46 were let go in districts 8 and 9 in the south bronx .
p.s. 36 " s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year , and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the extra financing for each poor student schools enroll .
the memo used the word " excess " to describe the action , even though " excess " more commonly describes the act of moving a teacher from a school 's payroll into a pool of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office .
all it took was for the revolt to succeed , longtime dictator moammar gaddafi to be captured and killed and american involvement to end .
" this resolution is about honoring the courageous people of libya as they begin to rebuild their country , " kerry said .
the language may sound innocuous , but nothing about the libya debate has been easy so far .
in june , kerry and mccain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of u.s. military forces in libya .
but on the same day that bill failed in the house , the chamber also voted down a measure that would have cut funding for american operations in libya .
the foreign relations committee resolution " congratulates the people of libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience in liberating themselves " and " commends the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners who engaged in military operations to protect the people of libya for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism . "
will the new measure earn the full support of the foreign relations panel , or will it split lawmakers like the june bill did ?
lugar 's spokesman said monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet .
the measure , sponsored by rep. bob goodlatte ( r - va. ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic to actually get a floor vote in the house or senate this congress .
goodlatte 's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced this congress , spanning a wide range of topics .
there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the house alone , and another handful that would " control federal spending . "
the budget control act , which passed in august , required that both the house and senate vote on a balanced budget amendment .
beyond the budget , several members want to limit the number of terms members of congress can serve , while rep. josé e. serrano ( d - n.y. ) wants to lift the two - term limit for presidents .
an amendment prohibiting same - sex marriage is a perennial offering , as is one prohibiting flag - burning .
as eager as members have been to offer amendments , they 're not moving at any faster pace than in past years .
the pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s , when members regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years , according to numbers provided by the senate library .
the last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 , but it was actually proposed by congress in 1789 .
ten months after a gunman shot her at point - blank range at a constituent event in tucson , rep. gabrielle gifffords ( d - ariz. ) appeared on national television monday night , sang along to the broadway show tune " the sun will come out tomorrow " and said she wanted to get better more than she wanted to return to congress .
the show documented her difficult journey back from the damage inflicted by a bullet that fractured her skull and pierced the left side of her brain , passing from the front to the back of her head .
in her first television interview since the january shooting that killed six and wounded 13 , giffords smiled , laughed and sang - and described her recovery as " difficult . "
the interview with giffords and her husband , astronaut mark kelly , was part of an hour - long " 20/20 " special that aired on the eve of the release of the couple 's new book , " gabby : a story of courage and hope . "
in videos shot by kelly in the first few weeks , she is seen in her hospital bed , her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead .
months later , giffords is seen sitting up in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions .
within days , giffords uttered another word - " toast , " a request for a change in her breakfast menu .
in the interview with sawyer , giffords , who goes through two hours of therapy every day , said she has no memory of the day of the shooting .
suspected gunman jared lee loughner is being held at a missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated as he awaits trial .
" so , i would say , " gabby , you have not been beaten , " " kelly said .
and you 're going to get through this , and you 're going to recover and you 're going to come back stronger than ever .
the event was a wall street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in new york city .
on cue , several hundred soldiers , sailors , airmen and marines strode into position around him .
" the servicemen and women were regarded as heroes , " said david saltzman , who organized the spring fundraiser .
" they were rolled out like some sort of orphan kid , " the officer wrote in an e - mail .
the starkly conflicting impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has taken hold between the military and an often distant , sometimes adoring american public .
" we are n't victims at all , " said brig . gen. sean b. macfarland , who commanded troops in iraq and will soon leave for afghanistan .
the topic is a sensitive one for military leaders , who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve .
as a result , most of the conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among combat veterans .
some would look at them with a sense of awe because they faced down insurgents and traveled to exotic places .
during his job search , he said , he sensed that some interviewers had subtly inquired whether he would be able to hold up under the strain of a demanding washington job immediately after his combat tour .
the military 's unease springs , in part , from american indifference to the wars .
" we , as a nation , no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in world war ii , " said retired lt. gen. david barno , who commanded u.s. troops in afghanistan .
troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured , the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries .
this week , a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for alleged inaction on rape .
pfc . elizabeth lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a fellow soldier .
he asked if he could join her in her room for a drink .
within minutes of entering lyman 's room , the man came up from behind her , throwing her down and raping her , she alleges .
the suit alleges that gates and rumsfeld failed to curtail widespread rape within the military , in violation of soldiers " constitutional rights .
burke says she is going after the military 's top brass because the problem begins with them .
" who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation ? the top leadership . "
her strategy : rather than piling all the plaintiffs into this case - putting all her eggs in one basket , so to speak - she will file multiple cases , if need be , to keep the pressure on .
the court papers , obtained by newsweek , detail the defense strategy - essentially , that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries incurred in the armed forces .
" the alleged harms are incident to plaintiffs " military service , " the documents say .
in both iraq and afghanistan , teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles , especially in reaching out to local women in war zones .
at yale law school , the veterans " legal services clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly fostering a misogynistic atmosphere .
her group filed a suit in december against the veterans administration , charging it with discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service .
in 2010 there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported , according to the department of defense 's sexual assault prevention and response office .
the report , released in march , also examines prosecution rates : in 2010 , 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half the rate of the civilian justice system .
in lyman 's case , she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred .
she did a rape kit , and her assailant 's blood - from a cut on his arm - was found in her bed .
six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator , who was eventually acquitted .
" i thought i was going to go into labor - i ran screaming from the courtroom . "
lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist , who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder , rendering her unfit for service .
as for whether the case filed by lyman and her fellow plaintiffs moves forward , it 's a long shot , says john turley , professor of law at george washington university law school .
what stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first issued .
the military is decades behind because they do n't have the same incentive and deterrent posed by liability .
these things only change when good people are willing to fight .
" we will continue battling the military on this issue until reform occurs , " she says .
on monday , breivik , who admitted to a killing spree in norway in july which left 77 people dead , faced his first public court hearing .
after this summer 's tragedy , researchers wanted to find out more about these people .
facebook 's stash of personal information is so encyclopedic , says bartlett , that the researchers could simply use the site 's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing for years .
by reaching out through facebook , bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey over 10,000 followers of 14 far - right parties in 11 european countries - all without ever leaving the office .
some of the results are n't all that surprising : online supporters of right - wing groups tend to be young , male , and vexed by immigration .
demos 's work is just one example of how facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists .
with over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day , the facebook " data supernova " is generating a research boom , driving the number of academic papers with the site 's name in the title up almost 800 % over the past five years .
" before , when you tried to survey people from the british national party , it would be very difficult to identify them . "
" facebook cuts all that out - you go to them directly . "
a recent study by dr. megan moreno of the university of wisconsin , madison and her colleagues found that undergraduates who discussed their drunken exploits on facebook were significantly more at risk for problem drinking than students who were silent on the topic .
" you ca n't treat a problem if you ca n't diagnose it , " dimitri christakis , moreno 's co - author and director of the center for child health , behavior and development at the seattle children 's research institute , told the washington post .
facebook , too , is constantly tapping into its own population for data .
but facebook 's users know the site is watching them , whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information .
while researchers have well - defined guidelines about how they collect their data offline , online it 's a free - for - all .
" as far as they were concerned , it was just between them and their friends . "
even offline , there 's no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest .
" what you say on facebook and what you do outside of facebook are two completely different things , " says selwyn .
" there 's no substitute for going into the real world and speaking to real people , " he says .
" cold and inhuman " : anders behring breivik makes first public court appearance
" i am a military commander in the norwegian resistance movement and knights templar norway , " he said before a courtroom packed with 500 people .
for the same reason he refused to allow breivik , who brought a pre - written speech with him , to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing .
around 30 survivors and victims " relatives attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but for me i moved on a little bit after seeing and hearing the suspect . "
despite breivik 's bizarre notion of being part of a larger " resistance " movement , the judge determined that he is not insane , and said that there is no evidence he acted with accomplices .
but that does n't automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels .
following the death of steve jobs on oct. 5 , there were some who compared him to henry ford - singling out the tech genius as the great modern inventor .
he was certainly a designer , dreamer and self - identified hippie , but he was also a meticulous organizer and flow - chart tweaker - a man who believed that many business executives suffered from " a disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... [ but ] there 's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product . "
at that point in time it had been roughly 10 years since jobs had been forced out of apple , and he was already hard at work at his new computer company next , looking forward to the popular adoption of the internet .
it was only following jobs " death that a complete vhs copy was discovered in the director 's garage .
for someone known to loathe in - depth interviews , jobs seems surprisingly eager here to expound on his technological philosophies and business strategies .
at four different points during the interview , there are major gaps between questions and answers - 10 to 15 - second ruminations , where jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts , aiming for precision .
filmed before the era of pixar , the ipod or the iphone , there 's something eerily prescient about the lost interview , as jobs assesses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong , and offers his own vision of the future of computing .
he has a vision for the way things could be and should be .
" throughout the years in business , i 'd always ask : " why do you do things ? " and the answers you invariably get are : " oh , that 's just the way it 's done . " "
baffled by the way costs were recorded - often beginning with a " standard cost " that amounted to a blind guess , which was then adjusted with a " variance " - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs down to the second .
jobs recounts the " blue box " that he built with steve wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free .
he describes how he and wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone , placing a call , and then connecting from one at&t network to another while looping in as many satellites as possible .
" we were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . "
jobs goes on to detail one glorious prank that he and wozniak nearly pulled of , ringing the vatican via the blue box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the pope , while doing their very best impression of henry kissinger .
on falling in love with technology ( and cold - calling bill hewlett ) :
not long after their 20 - minute phone conversation , jobs landed a part - time summer job at hewlett - packard .
jobs later became one of the hp employees to visit the company 's palo alto research labs , where he saw " the first desktop computer ever made . "
i would get a ride up to hp as a teenager and hang around that machine and write programs for it .
at several points in the interview , jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly .
working on only 30 days of credit , he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices .
" i remember having dramatic arguments ... they were screaming at me that it would take five years [ to build a mouse that would cost $ 300 ] , and i got fed up and went outside and found a designer . "
" say you work at ibm or xerox , so you make a better copier or printer , so what ? "
sales and marketing makes it more successful , so [ it 's those kinds of people ] who end up running companies and the product people get driven out of the decision - making forum .
it could have been ten times its size , could have been the microsoft of the 90s ...
you have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - fitting them all together ...
it 's part of what made the macintosh great , was that the people who were working on it were musicians , poets , artists , zoologists , historians who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world .
scalia and thomas dine with healthcare law challengers as court takes case
the occasion was last thursday , when all nine justices met for a conference to pour over the petitions for review .
the justices agreed to hear the suit ; indeed , a landmark 5 1/2 - hour argument is expected in march , and the outcome is likely to further roil the 2012 presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time the court 's decision is released .
clement 's law firm , bancroft pllc , was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society , a longstanding group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles .
another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant pfizer inc , which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the litigation .
in attendance was , among others , mitch mcconnell , the senate 's top republican and an avowed opponent of the healthcare law .
it 's nothing new : the two justices have been attending federalist society events for years .
in fact , justices are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower federal justices .
nevertheless , the sheer proximity of scalia and thomas to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , was enough to alarm ethics - in - government activists .
" the justices were wining and dining at a black - tie fundraiser with attorneys who have pending cases before the court . "
scalia and thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agenda - driven groups such as the federalist society .
moreover , conservatives argue that it 's justice elena kagan who has an ethical issue , not scalia and thomas .
her critics have pushed for kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case , saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now .
boeing also sells six boeing dreamliners to oman air , a deal worth more than $ 1 billion .
but it 's a big deal when the company is airplane - maker boeing co. and the list price for those 50 airplanes totals a record $ 18 billion .
in a forecast released monday , the chicago company estimates that airlines in the middle east over the next 20 years will need 2,520 airplanes worth $ 450 billion .
then on monday , boeing said oman air ordered six boeing 787-8s , the so - called dreamliner , which boasts dramatically better fuel economy and passenger amenities .
" this is clearly a huge positive for boeing , " morningstar analyst neal dihora said .
that 's important because they will be less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay airplane orders when fuel prices rise , dihora said .
the emirates order solidifies boeing 's lead in the market for wide - body planes and helps hold at bay competitor airbus sas ' attempt to encroach on its dominance with the a 350 airliner .
it delayed the debut to add more thrust after customers demanded more payload and range .
mexico president 's sister apparently defeated in michoacan vote
president felipe calderon 's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of michoacan during violent state elections , and she alleged monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents .
" the intervention by organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming , not just for michoacan but for the entire country , " luisa maria calderon said in a radio interview a day after sunday 's vote .
the pri ruled mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000 .
calderon , a candidate for her brother 's conservative national action party , or pan , refused to recognize vallejo as the winner .
aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results .
michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana , heroin and methamphetamines .
for the pri , though , however nasty the michoacan election looks , a win will help the party 's momentum .
rajat nag , the managing director of the manila - based adb , said the world 's two fastest - growing large economies had to " do all they can " to speed the recovery of the the currency bloc either through the international monetary fund or direct bilateral arrangements .
" asia may be shielded to some extent but it cannot be immune . "
europe 's monetary union has been badly undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in past months .
the unfolding sovereign debt crisis in europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession and prompted calls for leading emerging economies to band together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's minister of trade , said that " india will do whatever it can " to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering falling exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows .
" we have monumental challenges and we have to sustain a high level of growth . "
others argue that developing economies like india have no business helping wealthy europeans when they face their own profound economic challenges .
" sometime they will find out that greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to beaches and it wo n't go down well , " he said .
mr nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened " significant knock - on effects " across asia .
he said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make " contingency plans " to protect themselves from a downturn and significant capital outflows from their economies .
defense secretary leon panetta turned up the heat on congress monday , warning that looming automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and set off a financial chain reaction from the hallways of the pentagon , to the battlefields of afghanistan , to civilian assembly lines .
" the impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department , " panetta said in a letter to sens . john mccain , r - arizona , and lindsey graham , r - south carolina .
" such a large cut , applied in this indiscriminate manner , would render most of our ship and construction projects unexecutable -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building -- and seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote to the senators .
" these changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage readiness . "
" while wartime funding in the overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the sequester , war efforts would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the base budgets , " panetta warned .
" payroll personnel would be cut , resulting in late payments to wartime vendors , and legal and policy support would be disrupted . "
" the consequence of a sequester on the defense department would set off a swift decline of the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an outcome that we can live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves . "
whether the panetta letter and the fresh warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or step up calls to exempt the pentagon from cuts remains to be seen .
at a news conference last week , the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead -- a military with a shell but no core .
" it 's a paper tiger , an army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his opening remarks at the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the ax , including those already being tested and some just in early stages of planning .
halting further development and testing the f 35 could generate some $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years but its supporters say it is a vital next step to upgrade and meet potential threats from china and other rivals .
a glance at recent headlines indicates just how serious and pervasive deceit and lying are in daily life .
administrators at penn state have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations connected to the cover - up of an extramarital affair .
tales of cheating on school and college tests are rife .
mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating are acceptable .
on a given day , studies show , you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .
far from being a parlor game similar to , say , charades , where the object is to exclaim , " gotcha , " deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities conducting in - depth research projects , especially in psychology and physiology .
do n't conclude from this that liars are hard to spot and difficult to unmask .
i spent several years surveying the scientific findings in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge on deception , and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helpful in navigating our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring , interviewing , negotiating or managing .
we know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts , that men tell more " self - oriented " lies while women tell more " other - oriented " lies -- usually to protect someone 's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people do ( but the lies they do tell tend to be " whoppers " ) .
observe your subject 's posture , laugh , vocal quality .
deceptive people might freeze their upper body when trying to remember their story , they might point their feet toward the door , lean toward an exit , shift their posture in significant ways or exhibit " post - interview relief " -- that exaggerated exhale of relief and shift in posture when all the hard questions are over .
deceptive individuals might also use distancing language : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a hard question in its entirety .
someone might use lots of " qualifying language " when answering a hard question : " well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as i know ... to the best of my knowledge . "
there 's no magic bullet for detecting lies , but developing skills to ferret out deception is possible .
controversial oil pipeline plan to be rerouted after threat of delayed u.s. approval
transcanada said monday evening it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive sandhills area of nebraska , and is confident the project will still win approval .
transcanada official alex pourbax says the company remains confident it will eventually get a pipeline approved , albeit with a different route .
" this is a real path forward , " rep. lee terry , a republican from nebraska , told fox news .
obama , in a written statement last week , described the decision as the state department 's call , and expressed support for it .
it would carry 700,000 barrels per day from the province of alberta to refineries in texas .
it is hated by environmentalists but loved by labor groups , who have banked on the estimated 20,000 jobs tied to the pipeline .
the state department 's current environmental impact study found the project would pose only limited adverse environmental impacts , but the energy industry source said the department 's inspector general has ordered a separate probe of the review process , centering on two questions .
the other is whether a firm that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to transcanada .
a new york family claims that disco diva patti labelle launched into a rampage in the lobby of their manhattan building , terrifying their toddler daughter to the point where she threw up in fear .
it was nov. 10 of last year when stagehand kevin monk , his kindergarten - teacher wife , roseanna , and genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip .
roseanna monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a moment .
" i told her , " i have no interest in what you say or think . ' "
she had a bottle of water and started flicking water from the bottle on me .
" i said to this woman , " look what you 've done to my daughter , " " the child 's mother said .
labelle 's lawyer and representatives did not return calls for comment .
" the purpose is to hold patti labelle responsible for her conduct , " davis said .
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of sinaloa , being related to the first year of mario lopez valdez government also called the year of change , which generated great expectations as regards the development of the economy , but given the climatic adversity of the beginning of the year , there was no growth , however there was registered a decline in the main indicators of economic development .
according to the report regarding the areas affected by the frost , issued by the mexican council for sustainable rural development there were damaged 835.582 hectares , out of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining of 21.07 percent had partial damage . the main damaged crops were the vegetables , corn and chickpea .
" what we 're seeing now is an increase of the unemployment that has to do with several factors , including the loss of liquidity in the market for the purpose of a resource constraint imposed by the legislation that passed in the congress in order to combat money laundering since for the people who illegally possess dollars is not easy work with , invest and use them in something " he said .
lopez cervantes said that in the increase of unemployment there is also a demographic factor .
in addition to the unemployment and informality , another state labor reminder is represented by low wages ; the entity has the lowest wages in the country , according to the records of the mexican social security institute and the ministry of labor and social welfare .
for its part , the ministry of economic development of the state government accounted a total investment of 17.280.000 pesos during the year , which occurred mainly in tertiary sector companies .
against the backdrop of economic downturn , the state government asked in july during the state congress , the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos , which would be for the investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities , in order to reactivate the economy , the local congressional approval was for a total of 2.600 million pesos , and until november no benefits of the debt were observed in any sector of the state economy .
for business representatives , the first year of mario lopez valdes government demonstrates a lack of capacity of the government .
" the performance of the economy in sinaloa this year has been really poor , one has to work hard in order to regain the ground lost this year , in 2012 we must redouble our efforts , we failed to align the efforts of all and above all the good and synchronized motion of the new government team , we hope that next year will be much better " he said .
lopez loredo said that the events such as early frost this year stopped the state economy and its performance and growth were restricted .
" overall , we found that there has been working on , we believe it is necessary to develop a long term program that redefines the vocation and the economic course of the state , it is important to detonate all the material and human potential resource that sinaloa has , " he said .
coparmex president stressed the importance of establishing a future vision to guide better the efforts of the government .
he noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own manner of leading the public policy .
the general attorney office reported that the sentenced drug dealer is omar alexis valenzuela sandoval , for the crime against health , in its variant of possession of marijuana for purposes of trade .
the drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck , where he was carrying a black bag in the box of the vehicle and on the passenger 's seat a small backpack , where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana .
the director of municipal social development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced they are at risk because the state government failed to make the contributions that correspond , which represent a resource superior to 11 million pesos in all three programs .
" they have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime , since starting with july they had to give us a part , " he said , " in order not to delay we have started the works and they are very advanced , but we need the money . "
" it happened to us in the previous administration because the state did not have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued advancing , and this year in order to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending , " he explained .
" they have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime . "
the replacement of analog with digital is one of the most important changes that has hit the world in recent years
a minority of four ministers , including the president of the court , juan silva meza , considered that president felipe calderon did not exceed his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to take in order to achieve the transition to the digital terrestrial television .
the sentence project prepared by the minister olga sánchez cordero , proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree , because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the federal telecommunications commission ( cofetel ) , in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve .
with this argument , both the senate and the chamber of deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to contradict the decree , and to support the claims , the minister sánchez cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions stipulated there regarding the digital transition .
in his speech , the minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to get prepared .
the replacement of analog to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years , and results in a better utilization of the radio - electric spectrum , better signal quality and more channels .
these issues , he said , " require the operation of the entire system established under the principle of the state economic stewardship , comprises a group of powers which the constitution leads to the state executive power . "
there cannot be concluded that the government , by issuing the contested decree , that invades in any way the competence of the congress , is providing in the administrative area the observation of the laws issued by the legislature , he said .
according to the data transmitted by the perp the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial election is of only 27 percent , even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total of 6.074 minutes .
in this regard , the president of the general council of michoacán electoral institute ( mei ) , maria de los angeles llanderal zaragoza , recalled that a few days ago , the last november 9th , the electoral body approved a set of guidelines in order to harmonize the local regulations with the electoral federal reform .
the same november 9th , the supreme court of justice ( scj ) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and described as " invalid and illegal " the vote of the state representative for the constitutional reforms , since he has no right " to sanction or vote them . "
thus , the partial recount of one or more electoral boxes may occur in the assumptions that : the results of the records do not match ; there is no record of the count on the record of the box or they are not included in the power of the president ; or when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes .
the total vote count will also be done if at the end of the ordinary calculation is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate placed on second position is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as there is a request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came on the second position , case in which there will be excluded the electoral boxes that have been considered during the partial recount .
the remains of the pilot felipe bacio cortes arrived in saltillo , his hometown , this sunday night ; on monday there were carried out the reconnaissance and a requiem mass.
after receiving a tribute together with the other persons who died in the accident , the family of bacio cortes returned to the capital of coahuila on the board of an aircraft of the mexican air force , the closest people attended the ceremony at the campo marte .
at 5:30 in the afternoon he received the reconnaissance of the technological institute of saltillo organized by his former high school classmates and the football team , that felipe bacio was a part of , during his high school preparation .
for her , the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams , she considers that he was at the height of his life , " he was a successful man , an extraordinary father , son , and a loving brother and devoted to his family . "
some did not believe him , they said that he got dizzy even in the truck , but always wanted to fulfill his dream , that of becoming a pilot .
the young man recalls that even when he was seven years old he traveled to zapopan for the graduation of his relative , so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life : piloting an aircraft .
shot guns were fired for the lieutenant colonel of the mexican air force , felipe cortés bacio , headed by the governor jorge torres lopez , the people of the village and government of the state , the mexican army , through the sixth military zone , the mexican air force itself , managers and students of the technological high school of saltillo , where he studied in 1985 and made himself remarked both in study or in sport gave him the last farewell .
at 18:05 the remains of bacio cortés ( cremated ) , a citizen of saltillo arrived to be given by the funeral home to members of the mexican air force , led by major james martinez , on the esplanade of the training school , where he was already expected by his family , including his daughter amanda and his wife cristina , her mother , brothers and other relatives , students and teachers .
hours before the discovery , the military authority presented in media eleven persons who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime .

the designated italian prime minister , mario monti , will meet wednesday with the president of italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put italy on the edge of an economic disaster and has endangered the entire euro zone .
he is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats , although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position .
" i want to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country of getting out of this difficult phase , " said the former european commissioner to the reporters .
the new administration led by the former european commissioner monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the european leaders in order to regain the confidence in italy .
emma marcegaglia , leader of the italian employers ' federation told the reporters after meeting with monti : " we said we would support very much this government . "
monti 's chances of success were considerably boosted by the support of the ldp party of silvio berlusconi , who was forced to resign on saturday due to the crisis .
the support of the ldp , the largest party in italy , is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the government majority made of technocrats that monti is forming .
monti 's new government must have a strong parliamentary support for applying the reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms .
the italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of monti would be a disaster .
after a brief rest at the end of last week , when it became clear that berlusconi would resign , the italian debt costs have now reached critical levels between uncertainties about whether the new prime minister will succeed .
monti has said that his government would last until the next elections scheduled for 2013 , despite the widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before moving forward with the elections .
political sources said that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures .
of the 22 players called in spain , ten passed 50 international games .
a minor contrast to costa rica , comparing the 22 players called by both countries for the friendly game today , at 3:05 pm at the national stadium in san jose .
that number was reached friday before the game against panama ( 0-2 ) , in rommel fernandez .
to this is added the spanish fury experience in complicated qualifications for euro and world cup .
