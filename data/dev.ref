some like the birds , others would like to get rid of them as fast as possible . crows have been part of the cityscape for hundreds of years , but residents complaining about the filth and noise the animals create are increasing in number in many communities .
experts at the first crow symposium in the east frisian town of leer have said that rooks can no longer be forced out of cities .
hunting , increasing development and felling of typical breeding trees was making life hard for the birds .
there are large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the westphalian town of soest and in the north - west in jever , diepholz , achim bei bremen and leer .
critics described the capture of the birds in bird traps and how they were beaten to death with clubs as particularly brutal .
spraying off nests with water or felling trees often has undesired consequences , said environment expert manfred kaiser from lahr in baden - württemberg .
deterrence would only be conceivable as an exception in hospitals , retirement homes and schools .
without the surrounding area , the problem in the cities will not be solved , said leer 's mayor , wolfgang kellner .
" information boards instead of chain saws " was the slogan proposed by the psychologist and ethnologist uta maria jürgens , who argued for a totally different approach to the birds . " we should have the self - confidence to live with this problem . "
the intelligence and skill of the birds are legendary . rooks often do not just use tools to get hold of a choice morsel , but create tools themselves .
in one experiment , the birds quickly learnt that they had to knock over a platform to get to a moth larva .
in a second experiment , the canny crows had to solve a trickier problem .
all four birds used the wire to form a hook and used the hook to fish the bucket out of the tube by its handle .
the favourites portugal , croatia and the czech republic , plus ireland , will be at the 2012 european championship .

croatia did not miss a trick with 0:0 against turkey and ireland managed an easy 1:1 ( 1:0 ) against estonia .
the former wolfsburg bundesliga professional zvjezdan misimovic and captain emir spahic evened the score with a converted 41st - minute penalty and a goal in the 65th for bosnia .
bosnia had already been knocked out of the world cup 2010 playoffs in south africa against portugal .
ronaldo pounded a free kick into the nets from about 30 meters to take an early lead .
the bosnians , with no opening in the first half hour , had their first opportunity with goal scorer edin dzeko .
following an attack on helder postiga in the bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute , stark decided the portuguese player had simulated and gave him a yellow card .
after half - time , the vice - european champions of 2004 settled the score with four more goals .
the european champions of 1976 are going to the euro championship for the fifth time in a row .
goalie petr cech prevented a potential own goal from tomas sivok in the 9th minute with a split - second reflex .
damjanovic took a shot from the edge of the penalty area that just missed cech 's goal in the 40th minute .
the winning goal was scored just before full - time .
four days after losing 0:3 in istanbul , the turks could do no better than a 0:0 draw in zagreb .
the turks almost managed the perfect start in front of 31,000 spectators at the maksimir stadium .
croatia then woke up , taking more and more control of the game .
the budesliga legionaries danijel pranjic ( bayern munich ) and gordon schildenfeld ( eintracht frankfurt ) were on the field alongside mario mandzukic from vfl wolfsburg , who made space for ivan perisic from dortmund from the 62nd minute .
the irish in dublin were celebrating their first appearance at the european championship since 1988 in germany .
konstantin vassiljev equalised for the away team in the 57th minute .
the estonian rearguard prevented him at the last moment from taking ireland into the lead .
after a failed defence by goalie pavel londak , ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to bring the score to 1:0 .

here is advice for proceeding : gently excise this page and make it your bookmark .
what he has written here is an unusual book , one he describes , not inaccurately , as " a work of anti - history . "
it 's not so much a book about what happened , he explains , as " a book about what it was like . " it 's about " feelings , impressions , experiences and moods . "
their lives flicker here like votive candles lighted in a church ; new ones are added to the mix while some wink out .
it is a corrective too to the notion that world war i was only about the dire trench warfare on the western front .
soldiers in this book have beehives fall on them ; one has christmas in egypt under the pyramids ; tsetse flies are an intractable problem .
war floods these people 's lives like a natural catastrophe , a hurricane katrina that reeks of cordite .
" lack of facts , " mr. englund observes , " has been padded out with guesses , suppositions , hopes , fears , idées fixes , conspiracy theories , dreams , nightmares and rumors . "
their stories are mostly taken from memoirs , letters and other already published material .
many of these are about deprivation and making do .
" substitute coffee , fake aluminum , imitation rubber , paper bandages , wooden buttons . "
he describes " meat made of pressed rice boiled in mutton fat ( and finished off with a fake bone made of wood ) ; tobacco made of dried roots and dried potato peel ; shoes soled with wood . "
conversely a british soldier realizes that he will most likely die , and that no one will notice or care .
instead , it is horribly like " a condemned man being strangled secretly . "
" the conflict has increasingly become an economic competition , " mr. englund writes , " a war between factories . "
people behave in unanticipated ways ; there is as much base behavior as heroism .
" the most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonococcal pus , which soldiers buy and smear into their genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital , " he writes .
in this translation from the swedish by peter graves , mr. englund 's prose is supple but unshowy , perfectly suited to his humane task .
mr. englund 's volume joins an unconventional pantheon .
the overnight hours of monday into tuesday were chosen because zuccotti park would be at its emptiest .
police commissioner raymond w. kelly was at the center , his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department .
and so the police operation to clear zuccotti park of protesters unfolded after two weeks of planning and training .
a major disaster drill was held on randalls island , with an eye toward zuccotti .
the last training session was on monday night , on the manhattan side of the east river .
" the few cops that i know that were called into this thing , they were not told it was for going into zuccotti park , " said the person , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
one reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city .
the operation on tuesday involved officers from various police units , including boroughwide task forces - scores of mobile officers who are usually used to flood high - crime neighborhoods .
" it was appropriate to do it when the smallest number of people were in the park , " he said .
the lights and prerecorded messages booming from the loudspeakers seemed to cow many protesters .
no tents were touched until 1:45 a.m. , the police said , giving the protesters time to gather their belongings .
but many journalists said that they had been prevented from seeing the police take action in the park , and that they had been roughly handled by officers .
as the police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters " personal belongings , including luggage and plastic lawn and leaf bags stuffed with clothing , crews from the sanitation department followed , scooping up what was left behind .
a core group of protesters took up positions close to the encampment 's kitchen area , near the center of the park .
about 10 people in the epicenter of the encampment locked themselves together by their arms .
the clearing operation was complete about 75 minutes later , the police said .
most of the arrests were for " disorderly conduct and resisting arrest , " he said .
phil t. pulaski , the department 's chief of detectives , was also there .
a second group of officers waited along the eastern side of broadway , between liberty and cedar streets , in case they had to move in .
from those positions , the police were seen expanding the perimeter even farther outward from zuccotti park .
around 5 a.m. , south of pine street , one protester jumped on the hood of a police car , and others were seen releasing the air from the tires of a police van .
in the end , one officer and one protester were hospitalized .
the union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on wednesday , claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students .
six hundred seventy - two school aides , parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city 's lowest paid lost their jobs on oct. 7 , in a move union leaders have described as political payback for their refusal to let the city access a health care fund run by labor groups to close its budget gap last spring .
at a city council hearing last month , schools chancellor dennis m. walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget they signed off on in june .
district council 37 officials said they filed a notice of claim , warning the department of education that it would be sued ; it will hold a news conference on wednesday to announce the lawsuit 's filing formally , in state supreme court in manhattan .
elizabeth thomas , a spokeswoman for the city 's law department , said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations .
it points out that while there were no layoffs on staten island and few layoffs in schools in the upper east side or tribeca , 17 school aides lost their jobs in district 23 in brownsville , brooklyn , and 46 were let go in districts 8 and 9 in the south bronx .
p.s. 36 " s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year , and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates the extra financing for each poor student schools enroll .
the memo used the word " excess " to describe the action , even though " excess " more commonly describes the act of moving a teacher from a school 's payroll into a pool of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office .
all it took was for the revolt to succeed , longtime dictator moammar gaddafi to be captured and killed and american involvement to end .
" this resolution is about honoring the courageous people of libya as they begin to rebuild their country , " kerry said .
the language may sound innocuous , but nothing about the libya debate has been easy so far .
in june , kerry and mccain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of u.s. military forces in libya .
but on the same day that bill failed in the house , the chamber also voted down a measure that would have cut funding for american operations in libya .
the foreign relations committee resolution " congratulates the people of libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience in liberating themselves " and " commends the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners who engaged in military operations to protect the people of libya for their extraordinary bravery and professionalism . "
will the new measure earn the full support of the foreign relations panel , or will it split lawmakers like the june bill did ?
lugar 's spokesman said monday that he had not seen the final version of the new bill yet .
the measure , sponsored by rep. bob goodlatte ( r - va. ) , will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other topic to actually get a floor vote in the house or senate this congress .
goodlatte 's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced this congress , spanning a wide range of topics .
there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the house alone , and another handful that would " control federal spending . "
the budget control act , which passed in august , required that both the house and senate vote on a balanced budget amendment .
beyond the budget , several members want to limit the number of terms members of congress can serve , while rep. josé e. serrano ( d - n.y. ) wants to lift the two - term limit for presidents .
an amendment prohibiting same - sex marriage is a perennial offering , as is one prohibiting flag - burning .
as eager as members have been to offer amendments , they 're not moving at any faster pace than in past years .
the pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s , when members regularly offered more than 150 amendments every two years , according to numbers provided by the senate library .
the last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 , but it was actually proposed by congress in 1789 .
ten months after a gunman shot her at point - blank range at a constituent event in tucson , rep. gabrielle gifffords ( d - ariz. ) appeared on national television monday night , sang along to the broadway show tune " the sun will come out tomorrow " and said she wanted to get better more than she wanted to return to congress .
the show documented her difficult journey back from the damage inflicted by a bullet that fractured her skull and pierced the left side of her brain , passing from the front to the back of her head .
in her first television interview since the january shooting that killed six and wounded 13 , giffords smiled , laughed and sang - and described her recovery as " difficult . "
the interview with giffords and her husband , astronaut mark kelly , was part of an hour - long " 20/20 " special that aired on the eve of the release of the couple 's new book , " gabby : a story of courage and hope . "
in videos shot by kelly in the first few weeks , she is seen in her hospital bed , her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead .
months later , giffords is seen sitting up in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions .
within days , giffords uttered another word - " toast , " a request for a change in her breakfast menu .
in the interview with sawyer , giffords , who goes through two hours of therapy every day , said she has no memory of the day of the shooting .
suspected gunman jared lee loughner is being held at a missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated as he awaits trial .
" so , i would say , " gabby , you have not been beaten , " " kelly said .
and you 're going to get through this , and you 're going to recover and you 're going to come back stronger than ever .
the event was a wall street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in new york city .
on cue , several hundred soldiers , sailors , airmen and marines strode into position around him .
" the servicemen and women were regarded as heroes , " said david saltzman , who organized the spring fundraiser .
" they were rolled out like some sort of orphan kid , " the officer wrote in an e - mail .
the starkly conflicting impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has taken hold between the military and an often distant , sometimes adoring american public .
" we are n't victims at all , " said brig . gen. sean b. macfarland , who commanded troops in iraq and will soon leave for afghanistan .
the topic is a sensitive one for military leaders , who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve .
as a result , most of the conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among combat veterans .
some would look at them with a sense of awe because they faced down insurgents and traveled to exotic places .
during his job search , he said , he sensed that some interviewers had subtly inquired whether he would be able to hold up under the strain of a demanding washington job immediately after his combat tour .
the military 's unease springs , in part , from american indifference to the wars .
" we , as a nation , no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in world war ii , " said retired lt. gen. david barno , who commanded u.s. troops in afghanistan .
troops are recognized for the number of tours they have endured , the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries .
this week , a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for alleged inaction on rape .
pfc . elizabeth lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a fellow soldier .
he asked if he could join her in her room for a drink .
within minutes of entering lyman 's room , the man came up from behind her , throwing her down and raping her , she alleges .
the suit alleges that gates and rumsfeld failed to curtail widespread rape within the military , in violation of soldiers " constitutional rights .
burke says she is going after the military 's top brass because the problem begins with them .
" who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation ? the top leadership . "
her strategy : rather than piling all the plaintiffs into this case - putting all her eggs in one basket , so to speak - she will file multiple cases , if need be , to keep the pressure on .
the court papers , obtained by newsweek , detail the defense strategy - essentially , that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries incurred in the armed forces .
" the alleged harms are incident to plaintiffs " military service , " the documents say .
in both iraq and afghanistan , teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles , especially in reaching out to local women in war zones .
at yale law school , the veterans " legal services clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly fostering a misogynistic atmosphere .
her group filed a suit in december against the veterans administration , charging it with discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service .
in 2010 there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported , according to the department of defense 's sexual assault prevention and response office .
the report , released in march , also examines prosecution rates : in 2010 , 20 percent of reported cases in the military went to trial - half the rate of the civilian justice system .
in lyman 's case , she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred .
she did a rape kit , and her assailant 's blood - from a cut on his arm - was found in her bed .
six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator , who was eventually acquitted .
" i thought i was going to go into labor - i ran screaming from the courtroom . "
lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist , who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder , rendering her unfit for service .
as for whether the case filed by lyman and her fellow plaintiffs moves forward , it 's a long shot , says john turley , professor of law at george washington university law school .
what stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first issued .
the military is decades behind because they do n't have the same incentive and deterrent posed by liability .
these things only change when good people are willing to fight .
" we will continue battling the military on this issue until reform occurs , " she says .
on monday , breivik , who admitted to a killing spree in norway in july which left 77 people dead , faced his first public court hearing .
after this summer 's tragedy , researchers wanted to find out more about these people .
facebook 's stash of personal information is so encyclopedic , says bartlett , that the researchers could simply use the site 's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been doing for years .
by reaching out through facebook , bartlett and his colleagues were able to survey over 10,000 followers of 14 far - right parties in 11 european countries - all without ever leaving the office .
some of the results are n't all that surprising : online supporters of right - wing groups tend to be young , male , and vexed by immigration .
demos 's work is just one example of how facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists .
with over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day , the facebook " data supernova " is generating a research boom , driving the number of academic papers with the site 's name in the title up almost 800 % over the past five years .
" before , when you tried to survey people from the british national party , it would be very difficult to identify them . "
" facebook cuts all that out - you go to them directly . "
a recent study by dr. megan moreno of the university of wisconsin , madison and her colleagues found that undergraduates who discussed their drunken exploits on facebook were significantly more at risk for problem drinking than students who were silent on the topic .
" you ca n't treat a problem if you ca n't diagnose it , " dimitri christakis , moreno 's co - author and director of the center for child health , behavior and development at the seattle children 's research institute , told the washington post .
facebook , too , is constantly tapping into its own population for data .
but facebook 's users know the site is watching them , whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information .
while researchers have well - defined guidelines about how they collect their data offline , online it 's a free - for - all .
" as far as they were concerned , it was just between them and their friends . "
even offline , there 's no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest .
" what you say on facebook and what you do outside of facebook are two completely different things , " says selwyn .
" there 's no substitute for going into the real world and speaking to real people , " he says .
" cold and inhuman " : anders behring breivik makes first public court appearance
" i am a military commander in the norwegian resistance movement and knights templar norway , " he said before a courtroom packed with 500 people .
for the same reason he refused to allow breivik , who brought a pre - written speech with him , to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing .
around 30 survivors and victims " relatives attended the hearing .
" it was uncomfortable , but for me i moved on a little bit after seeing and hearing the suspect . "
despite breivik 's bizarre notion of being part of a larger " resistance " movement , the judge determined that he is not insane , and said that there is no evidence he acted with accomplices .
but that does n't automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels .
following the death of steve jobs on oct. 5 , there were some who compared him to henry ford - singling out the tech genius as the great modern inventor .
he was certainly a designer , dreamer and self - identified hippie , but he was also a meticulous organizer and flow - chart tweaker - a man who believed that many business executives suffered from " a disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... [ but ] there 's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product . "
at that point in time it had been roughly 10 years since jobs had been forced out of apple , and he was already hard at work at his new computer company next , looking forward to the popular adoption of the internet .
it was only following jobs " death that a complete vhs copy was discovered in the director 's garage .
for someone known to loathe in - depth interviews , jobs seems surprisingly eager here to expound on his technological philosophies and business strategies .
at four different points during the interview , there are major gaps between questions and answers - 10 to 15 - second ruminations , where jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts , aiming for precision .
filmed before the era of pixar , the ipod or the iphone , there 's something eerily prescient about the lost interview , as jobs assesses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong , and offers his own vision of the future of computing .
he has a vision for the way things could be and should be .
" throughout the years in business , i 'd always ask : " why do you do things ? " and the answers you invariably get are : " oh , that 's just the way it 's done . " "
baffled by the way costs were recorded - often beginning with a " standard cost " that amounted to a blind guess , which was then adjusted with a " variance " - he developed an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs down to the second .
jobs recounts the " blue box " that he built with steve wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long distance calls for free .
he describes how he and wozniak would test the box by using a pay phone , placing a call , and then connecting from one at&t network to another while looping in as many satellites as possible .
" we were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world . "
jobs goes on to detail one glorious prank that he and wozniak nearly pulled of , ringing the vatican via the blue box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the pope , while doing their very best impression of henry kissinger .
on falling in love with technology ( and cold - calling bill hewlett ) :
not long after their 20 - minute phone conversation , jobs landed a part - time summer job at hewlett - packard .
jobs later became one of the hp employees to visit the company 's palo alto research labs , where he saw " the first desktop computer ever made . "
i would get a ride up to hp as a teenager and hang around that machine and write programs for it .
at several points in the interview , jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly .
working on only 30 days of credit , he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the finished devices .
" i remember having dramatic arguments ... they were screaming at me that it would take five years [ to build a mouse that would cost $ 300 ] , and i got fed up and went outside and found a designer . "
" say you work at ibm or xerox , so you make a better copier or printer , so what ? "
sales and marketing makes it more successful , so [ it 's those kinds of people ] who end up running companies and the product people get driven out of the decision - making forum .
it could have been ten times its size , could have been the microsoft of the 90s ...
you have to keep 5,000 things in your brain - these concepts - fitting them all together ...
it 's part of what made the macintosh great , was that the people who were working on it were musicians , poets , artists , zoologists , historians who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world .
scalia and thomas dine with healthcare law challengers as court takes case
the occasion was last thursday , when all nine justices met for a conference to pour over the petitions for review .
the justices agreed to hear the suit ; indeed , a landmark 5 1/2 - hour argument is expected in march , and the outcome is likely to further roil the 2012 presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time the court 's decision is released .
clement 's law firm , bancroft pllc , was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society , a longstanding group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles .
another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant pfizer inc , which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the litigation .
in attendance was , among others , mitch mcconnell , the senate 's top republican and an avowed opponent of the healthcare law .
it 's nothing new : the two justices have been attending federalist society events for years .
in fact , justices are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower federal justices .
nevertheless , the sheer proximity of scalia and thomas to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , was enough to alarm ethics - in - government activists .
" the justices were wining and dining at a black - tie fundraiser with attorneys who have pending cases before the court . "
scalia and thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agenda - driven groups such as the federalist society .
moreover , conservatives argue that it 's justice elena kagan who has an ethical issue , not scalia and thomas .
her critics have pushed for kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case , saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now .
boeing also sells six boeing dreamliners to oman air , a deal worth more than $ 1 billion .
but it 's a big deal when the company is airplane - maker boeing co. and the list price for those 50 airplanes totals a record $ 18 billion .
in a forecast released monday , the chicago company estimates that airlines in the middle east over the next 20 years will need 2,520 airplanes worth $ 450 billion .
then on monday , boeing said oman air ordered six boeing 787-8s , the so - called dreamliner , which boasts dramatically better fuel economy and passenger amenities .
" this is clearly a huge positive for boeing , " morningstar analyst neal dihora said .
that 's important because they will be less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay airplane orders when fuel prices rise , dihora said .
the emirates order solidifies boeing 's lead in the market for wide - body planes and helps hold at bay competitor airbus sas ' attempt to encroach on its dominance with the a 350 airliner .
it delayed the debut to add more thrust after customers demanded more payload and range .
mexico president 's sister apparently defeated in michoacan vote
president felipe calderon 's sister appears to have lost her bid for governor of michoacan during violent state elections , and she alleged monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents .
" the intervention by organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming , not just for michoacan but for the entire country , " luisa maria calderon said in a radio interview a day after sunday 's vote .
the pri ruled mexico for seven decades until losing the presidency in 2000 .
calderon , a candidate for her brother 's conservative national action party , or pan , refused to recognize vallejo as the winner .
aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results .
michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana , heroin and methamphetamines .
for the pri , though , however nasty the michoacan election looks , a win will help the party 's momentum .
rajat nag , the managing director of the manila - based adb , said the world 's two fastest - growing large economies had to " do all they can " to speed the recovery of the the currency bloc either through the international monetary fund or direct bilateral arrangements .
" asia may be shielded to some extent but it cannot be immune . "
europe 's monetary union has been badly undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in past months .
the unfolding sovereign debt crisis in europe has raised fears that it could push the global economy back into recession and prompted calls for leading emerging economies to band together to help the eurozone find a solution .
anand sharma , india 's minister of trade , said that " india will do whatever it can " to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering falling exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows .
" we have monumental challenges and we have to sustain a high level of growth . "
others argue that developing economies like india have no business helping wealthy europeans when they face their own profound economic challenges .
" sometime they will find out that greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to beaches and it wo n't go down well , " he said .
mr nag said that the eurozone crisis threatened " significant knock - on effects " across asia .
he said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make " contingency plans " to protect themselves from a downturn and significant capital outflows from their economies .
defense secretary leon panetta turned up the heat on congress monday , warning that looming automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and set off a financial chain reaction from the hallways of the pentagon , to the battlefields of afghanistan , to civilian assembly lines .
" the impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the department , " panetta said in a letter to sens . john mccain , r - arizona , and lindsey graham , r - south carolina .
" such a large cut , applied in this indiscriminate manner , would render most of our ship and construction projects unexecutable -- you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building -- and seriously damage other modernization efforts , " panetta wrote to the senators .
" these changes would break faith with those who maintain our military and seriously damage readiness . "
" while wartime funding in the overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the sequester , war efforts would be adversely affected by the severe disruption in the base budgets , " panetta warned .
" payroll personnel would be cut , resulting in late payments to wartime vendors , and legal and policy support would be disrupted . "
" the consequence of a sequester on the defense department would set off a swift decline of the united states as the world 's leading military power . "
" this is not an outcome that we can live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves . "
whether the panetta letter and the fresh warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or step up calls to exempt the pentagon from cuts remains to be seen .
at a news conference last week , the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead -- a military with a shell but no core .
" it 's a paper tiger , an army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his opening remarks at the pentagon .
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the ax , including those already being tested and some just in early stages of planning .
halting further development and testing the f 35 could generate some $ 80 billion in savings over 10 years but its supporters say it is a vital next step to upgrade and meet potential threats from china and other rivals .
a glance at recent headlines indicates just how serious and pervasive deceit and lying are in daily life .
administrators at penn state have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting boys .
former presidential candidate john edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations connected to the cover - up of an extramarital affair .
tales of cheating on school and college tests are rife .
mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating are acceptable .
on a given day , studies show , you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times .
another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other .
far from being a parlor game similar to , say , charades , where the object is to exclaim , " gotcha , " deception detection is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities conducting in - depth research projects , especially in psychology and physiology .
do n't conclude from this that liars are hard to spot and difficult to unmask .
i spent several years surveying the scientific findings in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge on deception , and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helpful in navigating our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring , interviewing , negotiating or managing .
we know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts , that men tell more " self - oriented " lies while women tell more " other - oriented " lies -- usually to protect someone 's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people do ( but the lies they do tell tend to be " whoppers " ) .
observe your subject 's posture , laugh , vocal quality .
deceptive people might freeze their upper body when trying to remember their story , they might point their feet toward the door , lean toward an exit , shift their posture in significant ways or exhibit " post - interview relief " -- that exaggerated exhale of relief and shift in posture when all the hard questions are over .
deceptive individuals might also use distancing language : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a hard question in its entirety .
someone might use lots of " qualifying language " when answering a hard question : " well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as i know ... to the best of my knowledge . "
there 's no magic bullet for detecting lies , but developing skills to ferret out deception is possible .
controversial oil pipeline plan to be rerouted after threat of delayed u.s. approval
transcanada said monday evening it will move the planned pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive sandhills area of nebraska , and is confident the project will still win approval .
transcanada official alex pourbax says the company remains confident it will eventually get a pipeline approved , albeit with a different route .
" this is a real path forward , " rep. lee terry , a republican from nebraska , told fox news .
obama , in a written statement last week , described the decision as the state department 's call , and expressed support for it .
it would carry 700,000 barrels per day from the province of alberta to refineries in texas .
it is hated by environmentalists but loved by labor groups , who have banked on the estimated 20,000 jobs tied to the pipeline .
the state department 's current environmental impact study found the project would pose only limited adverse environmental impacts , but the energy industry source said the department 's inspector general has ordered a separate probe of the review process , centering on two questions .
the other is whether a firm that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to transcanada .
a new york family claims that disco diva patti labelle launched into a rampage in the lobby of their manhattan building , terrifying their toddler daughter to the point where she threw up in fear .

for its part , the ministry of economic development of the state government accounted a total investment of 17.280.000 pesos during the year , which occurred mainly in tertiary sector companies .
against the backdrop of economic downturn , the state government asked in july during the state congress , the approval of a credit of 3 billion pesos , which would be for the investment in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities , in order to reactivate the economy , the local congressional approval was for a total of 2.600 million pesos , and until november no benefits of the debt were observed in any sector of the state economy .
for business representatives , the first year of mario lopez valdes government demonstrates a lack of capacity of the government .
" the performance of the economy in sinaloa this year has been really poor , one has to work hard in order to regain the ground lost this year , in 2012 we must redouble our efforts , we failed to align the efforts of all and above all the good and synchronized motion of the new government team , we hope that next year will be much better " he said .
lopez loredo said that the events such as early frost this year stopped the state economy and its performance and growth were restricted .
" overall , we found that there has been working on , we believe it is necessary to develop a long term program that redefines the vocation and the economic course of the state , it is important to detonate all the material and human potential resource that sinaloa has , " he said .
coparmex president stressed the importance of establishing a future vision to guide better the efforts of the government .
he noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own manner of leading the public policy .

the director of municipal social development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced they are at risk because the state government failed to make the contributions that correspond , which represent a resource superior to 11 million pesos in all three programs .
" they have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime , since starting with july they had to give us a part , " he said , " in order not to delay we have started the works and they are very advanced , but we need the money . "
" it happened to us in the previous administration because the state did not have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued advancing , and this year in order to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending , " he explained .

the replacement of analog with digital is one of the most important changes that has hit the world in recent years
a minority of four ministers , including the president of the court , juan silva meza , considered that president felipe calderon did not exceed his authority by issuing a decree detailing the actions to take in order to achieve the transition to the digital terrestrial television .
the sentence project prepared by the minister olga sánchez cordero , proposed to declare unconstitutional the decree , because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the federal telecommunications commission ( cofetel ) , in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve .
with this argument , both the senate and the chamber of deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to contradict the decree , and to support the claims , the minister sánchez cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions stipulated there regarding the digital transition .
in his speech , the minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to get prepared .
the replacement of analog to digital is one of the most important changes that have hit the world in recent years , and results in a better utilization of the radio - electric spectrum , better signal quality and more channels .
these issues , he said , " require the operation of the entire system established under the principle of the state economic stewardship , comprises a group of powers which the constitution leads to the state executive power . "
there cannot be concluded that the government , by issuing the contested decree , that invades in any way the competence of the congress , is providing in the administrative area the observation of the laws issued by the legislature , he said .
according to the data transmitted by the perp the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial election is of only 27 percent , even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total of 6.074 minutes .
in this regard , the president of the general council of michoacán electoral institute ( mei ) , maria de los angeles llanderal zaragoza , recalled that a few days ago , the last november 9th , the electoral body approved a set of guidelines in order to harmonize the local regulations with the electoral federal reform .
the same november 9th , the supreme court of justice ( scj ) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and described as " invalid and illegal " the vote of the state representative for the constitutional reforms , since he has no right " to sanction or vote them . "
thus , the partial recount of one or more electoral boxes may occur in the assumptions that : the results of the records do not match ; there is no record of the count on the record of the box or they are not included in the power of the president ; or when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes .
the total vote count will also be done if at the end of the ordinary calculation is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate placed on second position is equal to or less than one percentage point , as long as there is a request of the representative of the political party whose candidate came on the second position , case in which there will be excluded the electoral boxes that have been considered during the partial recount .

the designated italian prime minister , mario monti , will meet wednesday with the president of italy in order to present the new government that will face the crisis that has put italy on the edge of an economic disaster and has endangered the entire euro zone .
he is expected to present a cabinet composed largely of technocrats , although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position .
" i want to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country of getting out of this difficult phase , " said the former european commissioner to the reporters .
the new administration led by the former european commissioner monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the european leaders in order to regain the confidence in italy .
emma marcegaglia , leader of the italian employers ' federation told the reporters after meeting with monti : " we said we would support very much this government . "
monti 's chances of success were considerably boosted by the support of the ldp party of silvio berlusconi , who was forced to resign on saturday due to the crisis .
the support of the ldp , the largest party in italy , is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the government majority made of technocrats that monti is forming .
monti 's new government must have a strong parliamentary support for applying the reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms .
the italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of monti would be a disaster .
after a brief rest at the end of last week , when it became clear that berlusconi would resign , the italian debt costs have now reached critical levels between uncertainties about whether the new prime minister will succeed .
monti has said that his government would last until the next elections scheduled for 2013 , despite the widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before moving forward with the elections .
political sources said that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures .

to this is added the spanish fury experience in complicated qualifications for euro and world cup .
