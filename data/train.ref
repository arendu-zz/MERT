today , the ukrainian parliament dismissed , within the code of criminal procedure amendment , the motion to revoke an article based on which the opposition leader , yulia tymoshenko , was sentenced .
in october , tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was reported to be a disadvantageous gas deal with russia .
tymoshenko claims the verdict is political revenge of the regime ; in the west , the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased .
the story of libya 's liberation , or rebellion , already has its defeated .
the transitional cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary sharia law , of which we have already heard .
women can forget about emancipation ; potential religious renegades will be executed ; etc.
libya will be in an order we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .
when winners are sought for in libya , the west is not on the list .
given the recent bad experience from afghanistan and iraq , we decided against military occupation of libya .
without the occupation , will the oil companies get libya 's black gold for next to nothing , though ?
france and the rest of europe are now in the investors " spotlight .
individual countries released their 3q gdp data .
eurozone statistical offices in germany , czech republic , and some other countries , released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter .
both countries also adjusted their second quarter data , where germany did better than expected ( a 0.3 % increase instead of the original 0.1 % ) . france reported a slight decrease , by 0.1 % ( the original information suggested stagnation ) .
between the quarters though , the gdp stagnated . according to the czech statistical office , this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowing of economic growth .
based on preliminary and seasonal data , in the third quarter , the german economy grew by 0.5 % .
despite the fact that the situation in the region is getting worse , earnings of czech 1 - year bonds stay under 4 % .
football representation successfully managed the toughest task of the season !
in the second half , czech football was lucky to maintain its luxury lead from the home return match , and will again feature at the european championship .
nearly no excitement in the first half , and a great portion of luck in the other .
perfect czech team defence only allowed the montenegro team to threaten in the second half .
the wonderful petr čech is one of the reasons the czech representation team will not miss the next year 's european championship . and czech football will thus gain nearly 200 million czech crowns .
both teams found it difficult to join in the combination ; the game remained around the mid - field line most of the time .
iranian students are prepared to die for their country 's nuclear program
several hundred university students created a live chain around the nuclear power plant in iran .
at tuesday noon , students ' prayers in front of the building were followed by their chanting of death to both the usa and israel .
this way , they express their readiness to protect their country 's nuclear program with their own lives .
possible attack on iran nuclear facilities has been discussed in israel .
in case of an attack , aimed at the highest possible paralysation of the iranian nuclear program , the targets would be , based on israel press , the facilities in both isfahan and natanz , where the uranium is being enriched .
over a third of children between 9 and 13 are overweight ; while 9 % of schoolchildren are overweight , 5 % are obese .
again , we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy development .
over 19 % of obese children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research connected to the educational event called obesity is no accident .
it was the second year of the obesity is no accident event supported by both všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna insurance company and unilever .
proper diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either overweight or obese .
in the czech republic , only 23 % of schoolchildren 's families have breakfast together .
the worst discovery was the fact that in one tenth of households people do not have breakfast at all .
a survey has shown that fries are consumed more often in the families of obese children .
though over 40 % of children do sports regularly , the number drops down to less than a half - 15 % - when it comes to their parents .
another part of the survey allowed selected children ( 204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools ) to compose their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions .
their favourite meals include large number of flour , meat , and sweet dishes .
as the main dish for lunch , pasta won very tightly over poultry .
" many participants from the survey control group showed a significant shift of preferences towards healthy food when completing a questionnaire after the end of the obesity is no accident educational lecture , " project results show .
in addition , for their main course , children ticked poultry and fish more often , limiting sweet meals and dumplings .
in the opening article on stylist training , i was complaining a bit about the amount of information in the introductory lessons .
lectures by three experts from the field ; dressing tips for difficult figures ; and a seminar on how it works in practise .
the closer we get to the final exam , the more information and practical tasks await .
this time , together with alenka , the director , ( there is not a single man in the course ) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry .
one has a short neck , the other has a boyish figure without proper curves , yet another is overweight .
we were given tips on how to accentuate the figure of women such as jennifer lopez , i.e. with bigger breasts and hips and narrow waist , and not to dress them too provocatively .
you will definitely not regret the investment , as perfectly fitting clothes are priceless .
boyish figures , on the other hand , can wear clothes with ruffling , appliqué , embroidery , or shirring .
still , i fear it is too much , with regard to the homework we were given .
we must consider their current appearance , their fashion style , and figure type .
inside i rejoice , as she is so much easier to dress than , say , britney spears , christina aguilera , who has recently gained about a ton ( please , understand i am exaggerating ) , or the very young selena gomez .
moodboard , as the result is called , then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depiction .
a stylist does not just dress physical people , but creates product pages in magazines ( based on specific instructions , for example , trendy purses , coats , etc. ) .
saturday 's lecture , filled with information on figure types , was livened up by three guests from the field .
jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion , and a stylist should be able to use this fact .
another option is rolling up the sleeves or collar , and the entire look changes completely .
however , i appreciated the following advice the most : " for your work , you need to know the rules perfectly . "
here i finally understood why we drill all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why , while in fashion magazines we often see something else .
from ben , the photographer , i learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions prepared than the number he is to take pictures of .
now i also know that in the picture , a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from reality .
honza pokorný confirmed that image and style often are half the success .
the attitude towards stylist services is still rather cold in the czech republic .
and if someone finally lets us create their styling , then we should expect them to give us different ( smaller ) size than what they really wear .
on sunday , both honza and mario were stressing the fact that for a stylist it is not enough to know about fashion and be able to create an outfit .
to be able to estimate people , not to pander , and stick to one 's opinion .
" find at least a few pieces you can praise , and recommend what to wear them with " mario says .
that is the bag you fasten around your waist to carry all the props you need .
to have some change from listening , and gain some practical experience , we learned how to properly underlay shoe soles .
i am beginning to realise that to be a professional stylist is no piece of cake , no matter what people say .
the ambitions were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any extra work .
it promised to shift the old need for speed racing series in a new direction ; the demos made it look like a game that might stand up in the action racing genre .
typical for the nfs series though , in the end many things are different from what we expected .
this means they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an incomprehensible laziness of the developers .
you are introduced into a story , where the main character , jack , decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an illegal race across america .
this means each race takes place on a different route , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments .
despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the series , some of the environments are very nice to look at .
driving through the desert , autumnal countryside , or high in snow - covered mountains is visually very pleasant though .
for example , in the desert , you get into a sandstorm , significantly decreasing the visibility .
for a while , you try to overtake a number of competitors ( basically a regular race ) ; then you try to beat the time ( standard stopwatch race ) ; or you are in a duel with a single rival .
it actually turns out to be good for the game , because this feature does not get to be boring ; within what was already said , it is one of the things that make the game more entertaining .
this means that it is nothing special anymore , but it cannot be considered a negative .
still , this driving model is fully suitable for the action style racing , even though we could find better at the competition .
from a game of this type , one does not expect complicated deformations and collisions , but when you have no idea , before crashing into any object , how your car will act , something is not right .
the restarts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track , the game takes you back to the last interrupted point .
if you use them up , you have to start the race from the beginning .
sometimes the restarts are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the race by heart .
for example , some turns have to be driven through in a specific way , otherwise you simply do not fit in .
this is especially annoying in situations where you can see how your rival drives through the two cars coming in the opposite direction so easily , while when you get there , the cars are already positioned so that you have to either drive around or slow down .
this is most obvious at the end of the game , on a long bridge , where you are driving in the opposite direction .
the thing is that when he is driving in front of you , he makes your vision worse , which causes you to crash the car a few times in the section .
it 's a pity , because despite the simple driving model , the game is entertaining and sometimes even so full of action you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
the key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode ; these are the races in individual locations you know from the story .
various features unlock fir getting a higher driver level : starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds .
yet another setback difficult to understand ; is the situation from the last race in the story .
your speedometer shows numbers from 150 to 200 km / h ( let 's say it does ) , when suddenly , a subway train comes running down from behind you , turning your car into a pile of scrap metal .
the technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary ; but the overall visual impression is mostly pleasant , sometimes even great .
this especially concerns accidents with large number of participants , where fluent recoding would not help you much anyway .
in order to please the widest possible young audience , the soundtrack is ' flecked in from all quarters ' ; but there probably will not be many people buying the game because of its music .
if the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes , we could sincerely say that the run is the best part of nfs for the past several years .
it surely is a nice entertainment , but prepare to be blinded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spotlights .
the third year of the festa academia festival offers joining the international students ' day and velvet revolution anniversary with a musical event .
the main focus of the festival is on two concerts taking place on november 17 .
" participating choirs include the choir of the pedagogical department and humanities ; václav hampl , the rector , will be in the committee , " jakub čaloun , head of the organisation team says .
celebration jazz mass , a piece by an important czech jazzman , karel růžička is on the programme .
the aim of festa academica is to celebrate the international students " day and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the velvet revolution with dignity ; as well as to present the public with top quality choir music , and to develop creative cooperation among young people .
the entire event is under the auspices of bohuslav svoboda , lord mayor of prague , and václav hampl , rector of charles university .
the programme offers both ceremonial concerts and numerous musical meetings , students " happenings , matinées , and more .
" it will take five or six years before the situation becomes somewhat stable , calm , and before all players get used to their new roles , " eu ambassadress milena vicenová opened her lecture at the law department sharply .
moreover , vicenová praised the work of new long - term president of the european council , herman van rompuy :
" he is a person who can listen to all twenty - seven member states , communicate with them perfectly , and who has a clear vision of where the eu should be headed . "
she said the fall of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the czech republic .
as the ambassadress said , both the presidency and the following financial crisis caused an ongoing stirring .
whether the budget will be slim and frugal ; which fields will be given preference ; which countries will be supported more and which less ; all of that is on the coming agenda .
" i really do not like all the abbreviations , foreign words , and jargon no one understands .
she also wants to use the eu environment better , and get more czechs into european institutions .
the ambassadress says czechs are said to be euro - sceptics ; as well as people noticing the negative rather than the positive sides of things .
she thinks numerous factors are to blame : for example , the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters ; together with low support from the czech side .
" believe me that when i meet someone from poland and hungary , and a slovak is coming to join us , the frenchman next to me says : " hey , what 's that gathering about , is that the visegrad group again ? ' and he is not happy about it in the slightest . '
rather than a new european federation , she finds the concept of two - speed , if not multi - speed europe , very realistic .
" we have schengen area , and we already have an institute of reinforced cooperation . "
" the number of such institutes will be growing ; it will be a highly two - speed europe , " vicenová expects .
should someone search for the word that would best express the imb strategy , the closest one would probably be " long - term . "
the company 's durability goes back to its first boss , a visionary , thomas j. watson sr.
his motto : ' think ! ' thus become an imprint around which the life of the future giant would unfold ( as well as the name of its internal magazine that imb started to publish in 1935 ) .
" for us in imb , long - term thinking means continuous movement towards the future .
during our first century , this allowed us to transform the technology , business , and the company .
consistent with the anti - discrimination strategy is the current plan expecting a woman , virginia rometty , to take over after palmisano next year .
in the last few years , imb has been organising jams , on - line brainstorming sessions , from which many future strategies and innovations arise .
" from the beginning , the concept of ibm was that of an institution rather than a technology company , ' a harvard business school professor and author of a book about ibm , rosabeth moss kanter , told the economist .
as the company itself says , there is a difference between entering a market and creating it .
it seems to be the most universal technology company - developing hardware and software ; infrastructure ; hosting ; and consultation services within a range from servers to nanotechnologies .
its inventions include , for example , the cash point , pay card , financial swap , bar code , and floppy disc .
" if your business is defined by movement forward , you cannot be emotionally attached to the past , ' says samuel j. palmisano .
this is how it differs from , for example , its competitor , microsoft , which basically stands and falls on windows , its operating system .
ibm 's revenues chiefly consist of services , about one fifth for each comes from software and hardware .
since 2000 , ibm has sold low profitable assets worth 15 billion dollars . during the same time , it has invested 58 billion dollars into purchasing of perspective technologies .
ibm follows the legacy of its first director , thomas j. watson , who increased the amount of investments during the great depression .
since the beginning of 2008 , the price of ibm 's shares has grown by remarkable 120 per cent ; company 's net earnings have been growing continuously .
we may therefore expect that even if another crisis comes , this flexible giant will manage .
ibm ( international business machines ) was founded in new york , a hundred years ago . its original name " computing tabulating recording corporation " was quite complicated .
foundations for the later ibm were laid by a merger of four companies , the history of which goes back to the 1880s .
the architect of the new company was a businessman , charles ranlett flint , who , until 1930 , also presided over the company 's board of trustees .
the leader then put the ibm 's founder in the shade - watson 's ideas remain the base for invincible company culture and identity .
ibm , as its name suggests , started by producing and selling various business machines - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers .
watson became so essential for the company , that after nearly forty years , his position in the director 's chair was taken by his son , thomas watson junior .
in 1960s , both people and computers from ibm helped nasa control space flights - to mercury , saturn , and in 1969 , man 's flight to the moon .
the classic pc that defined the computer standards of the period , called ibm 5150 , came to the market in 1981 .
in the past three years , ibm has been highly successful with its smarter planet concept .
for commerce , ibm has recently introduced a smarter commerce platform that helps businessmen control the whole commerce cycle .
in former czechoslovakia , as the first country in both central and eastern europe , ibm founded its branch in 1932 .
the headquarters for both central and eastern europe resides in prague , where there also is a world level research team focusing on voice recognition .
iveto , keep the fool , i do n't want him anymore !
after her husband , josef rychtář ( 53 ) , became both the bodyguard and lover of iveta bartošová ( 45 ) , darina still hoped he would wake up and come back home .
" pepa may return home , but no longer as my partner , " rychtářová explained .
even though she had iveta move out of říčany 30 days later , pepa would not leave the singer .
after some time , darina resigned , pretended to accept her husband 's affair ; and now she gave him her final goodbye .
even if one day rychtář and bartošová would split up , his wife will not welcome him with open arms .
" however , he will complete his days not as my beloved , lost and found old fool , but as a person i have certain bonds to , " rychtářová said , adding she had already disengaged herself from her husband and only insists on mutual decency .
" my wife decided for marriage on paper , and i respect it . "
" darina and i communicate in a completely normal way , only we do not share our bed anymore , " rychtář said for blesk .
" we do n't sleep together , and i do n't care where she goes , with whom , and if she has a boyfriend .
dear ladies , do you recognise yourself in the lines to follow , describing several women 's habits that make the men see red ?
some women recognise they should somewhat control their passion for shopping .
shopping may be a hobby for a majority of women , but for men , it may become absolute hell .
" i need to lose at least five kilos - should i start doing some exercise ? "
then , you belong to the group of women obsessed by their appearance .
the stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of such complaints , the more annoying women are .
do you blame your partner for stepping onto the clean tiles in dirty shoes ; your children for messing up a clean sink and leaving fingerprints over the glass pane in the living room that was so difficult to clean ?
this harmless desire for cleanliness may threaten your relationships , as well as the entire family .
" wet dishtowels do not belong on the floor . "
naturally , you mean well , you just want everything to be perfect .
women are focused on relationships , which is why they like to discuss who , where , who with , how , and why .
in both cases , claude giroux , used the experience of a thirty - nine year old star ; he added an extra pass and was announced best player of the match .
after the match , jágr told the overseas journalists he had predicted a great evening for giroux .
a little bit later , second score for the team bore czech traces too .
a second before the first break , a home player , patrick dwyer , narrowed the lead in a power - play , but the beginning of the second part was led by flyers again .
after assist with jágr , he scored the third goal ; consequently , his shot was touched into a fourth goal by wayne simmonds .
" i do n't ; want to say he 's the best league player , but he 's definitely among the best three , " said jágr , complimenting his center .
" all those years in nhl , my team - mates tried to assist me , and now its reversing , " jágr added .
further complications were avoided by matt read who increased the difference to two points .
" he poked out the puck , i gained speed , and read went on to the more distant pole . "
its victory moved philadelphia onto the top of the eastern conference .
along with the experienced back , the candiens lost their two - goal lead and lost 2:3 after a penalty shoot - out .
more than lost points , the home trainer was sorry for high sick rate in the back , as the match was finished with just five defenders .
" we finished the match with just one experienced player , the rest were young men . "
" substitution by substitution , it was overwhelming and we could n't resist . "
" that was our weakness , " a defender , p. k. subban added .
jets " goals , which interrupted a five - match series of losses , were shared by five different scorers .
until 1989 , only five state travel agencies were allowed in the former czechoslovakia : čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea , and autoturist .
for their holiday , czech tourists thus went to the sea to the german democratic republic ; soviet union ( sochi , crimea near the black sea ) ; bulgaria ; romania ( both to the black sea ) ; and hungary ( balaton ) .
a great paradox of the socialistic period was that citizens of the socialist block ( i.e. czechoslovaks too ) were not allowed free individual travel within the socialist countries .
at the time , travel agencies would offer some trips to the west , but one either had to stand in a line overnight , with a sleeping bag or have some " good friends " in the agency .
a foreign currency assurance was essential for travels to the west . it was not granted to politically unreliable people , who were not allowed to travel at all .
most often , czechs spent their holiday at home , which resulted in great number of cottages and summer houses , a habit that survives until now .
while until 1989 , a holiday in the gdr or bulgaria was the climax of our travels , last year , czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries all over the world .
right at the beginning of 1990 , visa requirements for neighbouring west european countries were cancelled . this started a huge wave of short - term visits of chiefly vienna and germany .
for example , in paris , czech tours slept in parks in tents , because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or a pension .
another important moment was the introduction of freely convertible czech crown . after decades , our tourists thus finally able to freely buy western currencies .
since 1997 , increased demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips by charter airlines . compared to the past , air trips thus became unbelievably cheap due to the ability to order quantity discounts .
the next significant event in the history of after revolution travelling came in 2000 . high demand resulted in the historically first direct charter flight from the czech republic to an exotic country , thailand .
on november 17 , 2008 , the usa removed visa requirements for czech tourists . our country has thus permanently joined the world 's most developed countries .
jindřich rajchl , miroslav pelta , and tomáš paclík are eager to lead czech football .
however , hašek 's era sees football back in quarrels between both association chambers , unable to agree on a common candidate .
general meeting delegates wasted their trip to the national house in prague , smíchov , as the negotiations remained blocked , not just regarding the election method .
this single point has been partially settled since , thanks to a recommendation of the institute of state and law , according to which representation based on power of attorney is not possible .
the executive board has not been of much help either , though at its meetings , both regular and extraordinary , it is mostly preoccupied by this issue .
the question is : how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid mate ?
based on the model given by the by - laws , the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber he is the candidate for .
the czech part stresses a condition that in the percentage total , the winner must gain at least two - third superiority .
somewhat surprisingly tomáš paclík agrees with his opinion even if it is estimated that the election rules defined by the by - laws fits pelta best of the candidates .
" i want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense , as at the previous general meeting , " says the owner of viktorie plzeň , who is a candidate for the first time ; and in his statements he chiefly stood against pelta .
he believes the new president will be known in nymburk ; he also hopes that in the future , the candidates will cooperate constructively .
" football will be back on the happy wave , people will be more willing to cooperate , " a jablonec functionary says . of the three candidates , he has the most experience with football management on both professional and regional levels .
" i hope for an agreement , but the situation is very ambivalent . "
there is not much time left for an agreement between the parties .
an extra flight that was to take , among others , the vice presidents dalibor kučera and rajchl to podgorica did not leave prague in the morning due to a technical failure . an alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the barraged rematch .
minister of education , youth , and sports , josef dobeš , would like to force the split parties inside the strongest sports association in the country to reach an agreement .
paclík enters the presidential fight as he cannot see a suitable candidate
" if there was a good quality candidate , i 'd fight for him and not participate in the fight . "
paclík 's motivation to join the fight with miroslav pelta and jindřich rajchl is to try to prevent pelta , reportedly the favourite of the elections , from entering the top of the fačr .
in the future , he would like to see the position given to an experienced top manager , not excessively connected to football life .
" i was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this point , they do n't even want to identify themselves with czech football . "
at the moment , paclík 's strongest disagreement with pelta is based on the latter 's connection to roman berbr , president of pilsen 's regional football association . berber is a man of controversial reputation , who is , behind the scenes , known as powerful lobbyist , capable of influencing the votes of general meeting delegates .
" if he wins , current situation will be preserved and nothing in football would move forward . "
he is hinting at the fact that some years ago , pelta 's name was recorded during phone tapping in a corruption affair investigation ; pelta came out without a sentence .
" and how would we look in the eyes uefa and fifa , " paclík said . he is now more detached from his former statement saying he would " sell the pilsen club if pelta became president . "
this opinion is shared by another candidate , rajchl , whom paclík supported before the september general meeting that ended as a fiasco .
paclík claims he would dare to manage the association .
" i have the strength to make the football environment change , to support its improvement . "
one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between fačr and the czech olympic committee , with whose support he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax .
" if taxes are imposed on gambling , as the political parties declare , i understand their arguments , but they must clearly say where the money will go , " he said .
pelta is connected to jablonec , and rajchl to prague dukla .
" yet , i do n't see a point in transferring my shares in the pilsen club hypocritically to someone else , while coming back there in six months , " paclík says .
two days before the general meeting of the football association , one of the presidential candidates , miroslav pelta , promised that if he is elected , he would strive for new fačr regulations to avoid future disputes over the election rules .
prior to the failed election in september , pelta promised that if he was to win , he would focus on both the representation and gaining of financial means .
" people at all levels have been in football for long , and they expect the president to be known on thursday . "
this gives him the reason to believe he is experienced enough to manage czech football .
" unfortunately , regulations that were not as perfect as we all thought were passed at the general meeting in june . "
he approached the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a decoy for the delegates .
" it is a fundamental issue we cannot exist without , " pelta claims .
in the past , he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with jindřich rajchl , whom he recognises for his legal education ; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president .
" he 's been in football for over a year , and gained some success . "
" this is too , is why some of them now doubt his true character , " pelta said about his rival . pelta himself claims to be true to the proclamations he announced in september .
" right after that , i would focus on negotiations with both private and state sectors , to ensure enough money for the whole football , " the forty - six year old candidate told čtk two months ago .
" i 'd need to learn about the job descriptions of individual employees . " that was his message for strahov , where the long period of interregnum causes understandable nervousness .
" if the only questionable point is how to perform the elections in the third round that is something we can get over . "
rajchl promises that under him , the fačr will start working hard
rajchl promises that if he is elected , hard work will come .
he also promised to solve the bohemians case ; improve relations with both uefa and fifa ; bring more money to football ; and continue the work of the previous president , ivan hašek .
" from international contacts with uefa and fifa , to representation , professional football , and performance football for the youth . "
" i 'm a team player , and i want to distribute the competences within the executive board so that each member focuses on a certain area . "
" that would probably not please many people , as it would mean hard work , not just criticizing of the work of others , " he added .
" i 'm known to work 20 hours a day . "
" however , many people told me i must n't give up , otherwise others would follow . "
moreover , he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with hašek .
" processes have been started that may bear fruit in a few years , and i do n't want someone else to stop them , " he said , in fear that if the other candidate , miroslav pelta , is elected , situation f the association might return to the period before hašek .
" he is chiefly surrounded by people who would do football so that it would only be for the chosen ones . "
furthermore , he refutes the allegations he would only be a czech president .
" for example , it is high time to consider about splitting the second league into czech and moravian parts , winners of which would continue into the first league . "
as the presidential fight has been joined by pilsen club manager , tomáš paclík , rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances to win .
on the other hand , he considers the fact that the association does not stick together partially as his own fault .
" no one can doubt that he did a great job in pilsen this year . "
" he would n't want to twist things for his own benefit , " rajchl said about his rival .
paddling pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in budapest . travellers can experience europe 's incredible water - and relax tired limbs in a jacuzzi after a city tour or a ramble .
there was one thing iris meder could not do without on research trips over the last one and a half years : her swimming costume .
she rushed to add any pool she liked to her notebook - with essential details on the construction and the history of the building .
her " journey to the most unusual baths in central europe " took here through 13 countries . besides germany , austria and switzerland , she visited baths in italy , france , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , romania and poland - and one city each in luxembourg , serbia and croatia .
she has very little enthusiasm for sport , says meder - but in the water , it 's a different matter .
" one day , i asked myself why swimming baths always have to be so ugly , " says vienna - based meder .
and swimming baths can be a real treat for the eyes if the builders have gone to the trouble . " you have the surface of the water in pools instead of a floor . "
everything is mirrored visually : high ceilings , colourful tiles and diving boards .
pool collector meder discovered some notable examples during research in hungary .
many of the heated outdoor baths in switzerland and austria , on the other hand , offer spectacular views . you can view all of zurich from a rooftop bath or look out on the snow - capped arlberg from an outdoor pool in st. anton . and there is a window in the steam bath giving a view of the action on the ski piste .
it steams during the winter from three open - topped shells dwarfed by the ötztal mountains behind it .
pool collector meder was not greeted by the smell of chlorine in every swimming pool .
the smell comes from the hydrogen carbonate in the alkaline water . the water is almost black with silt that sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a particular kind .
the baths , designed by the architect dušan jurkovic in 1902 , have been closed .
one place where decay has been stopped in its tracks is a magical swimming bath in the black forest - the palais thermal in bad wildbad .
following its careful modernisation in 1995 , the palais thermal is the favourite swimming pool of pool connoisseur iris meder - and not just because she comes from the black forest .
for german citizens the situation is clear . according to one study , 84 percent of germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize .
the findings were made in a survey conducted by the forsa institute for social research and statistical analysis on behalf of the consumer organisation foodwatch .
the author of the report , harald schumann , shows that betting on global commodities exchanges drives up prices - and the banks are therefore complicit in global hunger .
originally , commodity betting was designed as a means of protecting traders against price fluctuations .
in contrast to us competitors , ackermann has responded to the criticism . he has promised to investigate the accusations and has said that no trade is " worth putting deutsche bank 's good reputation at risk . "
the investigation should be complete by the end of the year when the findings will be presented to deutsche bank 's board of managing directors - with recommendations for action .
the president of foodwatch , thilo bode , welcomed the news while emphasising his criticism of the financial sector . " betting on rising food prices is an extreme example of how thoughtlessly banks are currently acting against the common interest . "
" deutsche bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that bet money on food prices , " said bode .
ackermann 's sensitive response is at first surprising , but then the ceo would like to present a perfect image just a few months before the end of his term in office .
cancelling contentious food commodity speculation could improve his image .
to date , more than 30,000 internet users have joined the organisation 's campaign .
no more than eleven percent think it is legitimate for deutsche bank to offer investments that bet on the price of foodstuffs .
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank , 49 percent said they would think about closing their account and switching to a different bank .
an architectural history with highs , lows and a happy - ever - after . austria 's pavilion for the 1958 world 's fair in brussels won prizes , became a museum in vienna , stood empty and was abandoned .
austria 's pavilion , designed by karl schwanzer for the 1958 brussels world 's fair , is a famous textbook example of modern post - war architecture with its clear shapes , glass halls , bold strokes and the new construction materials that expressed belief in technical progress .
he finally shot to fame internationally in 1973 with his legendary four - cylinder bmw tower and its bowl - shaped sister building .
however , the building was not suitable as a museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls to hang artworks and poor air conditioning .
the building stood empty from 2001 and fell into a worse and worse state of repair .
the museum is a branch of the belvedere museum , which will open the first exhibition on tuesday evening - a delight in every respect .
husslein - arco , an art history graduate with a remarkable career in her youth as an ice skater , who went on to sotheby 's , the guggenheim museum and to become the founding director of the museum der moderne in salzburg , convinced politicians and conservators to go ahead with renovation , attracted public funding and private sponsorship and decided on the use of the building .
he was known , of course , for having renovated and expanded joseph olbrich 's secession in vienna , and had won the competition , but he also studied under schwanzer at the vienna university of technology and the pavilion was an " exceptionally important place " for him where had visited exhibitions " almost every weekend . "
the problems facing the latest alterations were much greater . the building was " an energy guzzler , " says krischanitz .
thermal bridge steel girders were strengthened or replaced and asbestos was removed from ceilings .
the original external doors have been retained and the building has been painted in the old red - brown colour of rust - proofing .
all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a limited budget .
architecture like this is " always in the wrong place " and nonetheless wants to " stimulate a real awareness . "
there may also be a second stroke of luck . the 21er haus may be bolstered by another krischanitz building - the collector francesca von habsburg has purchased the temporäre kunsthalle berlin and is reported to be negotiating with the city for a neighbouring location in the schweizer garten .
deutsche bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in the winter .
referring to an internal crisis plan at deutsche bahn , the bild newspaper has reported that investment of around 300 million euros in total is planned up to 2015 .
the number of internal and external employees involved in removing snow from rail facilities and platforms is to double to 16,000 .
rüdiger grube , head of deutsche bahn , warned of train cancellations and delays this winter at a summit with government and industry two months ago .
deutsche bahn has also been forced to have the axles of ice trains checked significantly more frequently for many years , after an ice train 's axle broke in cologne 's main station .
fresh trouble is following hard on the heels of the uproar around josef ackermann , ceo of deutsche bank : deutsche bank faces a multi - million pound fine in the usa .
the value of the securities dropped dramatically during the financial crisis and brought down the credit unions .
the ncua chairman , debbie matz , welcomed the responsiveness of the two banks .
the regulator had also approached other major banks and sued jpmorgan chase , the royal bank of scotland and goldman sachs in the summer .
the us investment bank , lehman brothers , went belly up in september 2008 at the height of the financial crisis .
investors and regulators have brought a vast number of claims for compensation or to punish misconduct .
it accuses 18 major international banks of having taken in us lenders fannie mae and freddie mac on mortgage transactions valued at around 200 billion dollars .
the regulator is demanding that the frankfurt - based bank take responsibility for " substantial losses , " but has not yet specified the exact sum .
since march , he has bought up shares totalling more than ten billion dollars .
however , ibm 's annual reports changed his mind on investing in the industry .
buffett revealed that he had purchased ibm shares totalling 10.7 billion dollars since march on the us business news broadcaster cnbc .
buffett said that even ibm knew nothing of his involvement until recently .
" they have done a great job , " said buffett , referring to the management strategy .
the computer pioneer - now more than 100 years old - also provides software and consultancy services , as well as powerful business computers .
his holding company , berkshire hathaway , owns shares in a long list of major companies such as coca - cola and munich re ( formerly münchener rück ) alongside around 80 of its own subsidiaries .
his almost infallible instinct for making money has earned him a nickname as the " oracle from omaha . "
" big blue , " as ibm is also known , is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock exchange , making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world alongside apple and microsoft .
following the discovery of the " zwickau cell , " turkish media express doubt about the rule of law in germany .
the murder of eight turkish and one greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of right - wing extremist ideology .
for many german turks , the news brings back to life a long - dead spectre . there has been no comparable right - wing extremist violence against turks since the arson attacks in mölln in november 1992 and in solingen in may 1993 .
the right - wing extremist network that has now been discovered , however , is on a scale that has not yet been fully understood .
the sabah newspaper , on the other hand , points out that one of the perpetrators was a confidential informant for the intelligence services and expresses concern that the german authorities may be caught up in the right - wing extremist quagmire .
just two weeks earlier , the turkish community in berlin had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the german - turkish bilateral agreement on labour recruitment in a ceremony with german and turkish politicians .
the coverage by some turkish media has been like a slap in the face . " germany 's present on the fiftieth anniversary " is the title of one article on the haber x turkish internet platform , which comments on the circumstances around the series of murders .
the behaviour of the police and the subsequently successful manhunt is heavily criticised on german - turkish internet forums .
some writers even go as far as some strong rhetoric . " if things continue to be done so cack - handedly , migrants have no option but armed self - defence . "
" peace in germany depends very strongly on how the entire network is uncovered and on the appropriateness of punishment , " writes " selen . "
the photo of the burnt out ruin of solingen is deeply engrained in german and turkish memory .
the attacks , however , increased the sense of turkish unity .
the turkish press at the time complained mainly of the failure of german policy following the attacks . helmut kohl declined to visit the survivors in mölln .
just as if he were calculating the value of a person by the taxes he pays .
straight talking is what is needed now , alongside efforts to identify and reassess right - wing extremist terrorism in germany .
the most risk - taking bank in europe is not in italy or france , but in switzerland .
after his spectacular departure from the head of the federal bank , it was announced in july that he would be starting an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013 : chairman of the board of directors of the major swiss bank ubs - an unexpected and lucrative career move .
but by september it was already clear that everything would be very different .
ubs ceo , oswald grübel - a banker not only famous in switzerland - had to go .
all at once , he is taking on responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again proven that it has long deserved the title of " europe 's biggest banking scandal . "
as a result , in 2007 ubs was managing 1.6 billion , thereby managing more more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world ,
" from what we know today , you have to ask how i could be so wrong . "
it only became clear in 2007 that something was really going very wrong at ubs .
ubs announced a capital increase , believe it or not , of 13 billion swiss francs to face the crisis .
the bank was forced to announce new losses running into the billions and chairman of the board of directors , marcel ospel - the second best paid chairman in switzerland in 2006 - resigned .
the national bank bought up toxic securities from ubs for untold billions and the swiss confederation paid six billion swiss francs for a mandatory convertible bond to become part owner of the bank .
after all , the balance sheet total for ubs in 2007 was more than five times the economic output of switzerland ( see chart ) .
ubs also agreed to pay 780 million dollars consisting of repayment of unjustified profits from the business and a penalty .
at the same time , ubs lost something that had always been its advantage when competing for rich clients - the fog of secrecy .
the ceo and the chairman then resigned and
the bank had lost its credibility in both of its core business divisions within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by aiding and abetting tax evasion .
one thing is clear - risk management in the investment banking division is still not working .
the cfo of one major german bank also has no doubts : " the problem facing ubs is that it does not having a handle on risk control . "
the safes of swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability , just as lindt and sprüngli had come to symbolise sophisticated chocolate .
the buildings are ostentatious and the shop rates are among the highest in europe .
the swiss banks have resided here for hundreds of years - from the national bank to the palace of credit suisse and elite private banks such as julius bär .
the walls within are clad in marble behind vast leather armchairs . there is a large sign to the " safe " next to the bank 's logo .
but both the major swiss banks , ubs and credit suisse , at some point ousted the swiss banking concept - or betrayed it , as the head of one small swiss private bank believes .
he believes ubs has grown too big - particularly in investment banking where the anglo - saxons are also very active .
" and if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the anglo - saxons long ago . "
the politicians approved up to 68 billion swiss francs ( around 45 billion euros ) to save the bank from bankruptcy .
talking to swiss banks , they see the issue mainly in the size of ubs .
a bank was created that was already too big for small switzerland when the merger was agreed - and a bank that continued to grow .
the internationalised investment bankers suddenly had access to a lot of money that they could use to turn an almighty wheel .
" i always thought that wuffli and ospel were a dream team , " says the banking research , hans geiger .
the american bank was the world 's most powerful investment bank .
ubs was a major player in foreign exchange and stocks .
hungry for growth , the bank itself and a hedge fund founded by the bank invested in us subprime securities .
even when other banks had long been looking for a way out , ubs carried on .
posts at ubs became a game of musical chairs and remain uncertain to this day .
he must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models .
the bank , however , is not ( yet ) prepared to go that far .
the new head of the bank , sergio ermotti , plans to present his future strategy to the world on tuesday .
since then , he has proved his mettle and is now to head ubs permanently , the zurich - based bank announced on tuesday .
publicly , he has only so far that he and his wife will look for a flat in zurich .
fear of recession in europe depresses us stock exchange
the change of government in athens and rome had little impact .
the general relief following the change of government in rome and athens was not sustained .
the italian and greek glass was still considered half full last week , not half empty - now the problems are coming to the fore once again , said mark luschini of janney montgomery scott .
the dow jones industrial average closed business at 12,078 with a fall of 0.6 percent .
the broader s&p 500 index closed at 1251 point , down one percent .
the eurostat statistics office announced that , in september , companies produced two percent less than in the previous month .
he also claimed that europe is not likely to shake off a recession quickly and that there are further signs of weakness in the banks .
in his opinion , it is therefore too early to invest in european government bonds or banks .
his investment of more than ten billion dollars in ibm boosted the veteran company 's share price by almost one percent against the trend during the course of trading .
buffett claims to have paid 170 dollars on average per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake .
bank of america share certificates fell significantly more strongly than the market by 2.6 percent .
the bank primarily plans to bolster its capital quota with the net profit from the sale to meet tougher regulations .
the share price went up 1.5 percent after the corporation picked up the biggest order in its history .
